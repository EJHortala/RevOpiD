These are songs that you will find yourself singing, humming, and thinking about after just a few listens.

That is obvious in the initial hearing of the CD.  I appreciate the talent, but even more I appreciate the love that she has for music.  I've seen and heard many performers in several different genres of music, but it is becoming a true rarity to encounter artists who really, truly love what they do.  You can tell that Alison Krauss (and Union Station) has a geniune joy in doing what she does.  It comes across in the music.  That joy of singing, performing, communicating with an audience is sadly lacking with most artists today.  Too many artists (some who once had this joy and lost it somewhere along the way) are in music for all the wrong reasons...money, fame, you name it.  Krauss will have none of it.  She still records for Rounder Records, a relatively small label, even though she's had offers from the big labels.  She refuses to perform in big arena concerts because she would lose the close connection she has with her audience.  I admire her for her decisions and for her love of her craft.

In this one compilation she has bested Dolly Parton, humbled Lennon & McCartney, and made God blush.  Every turn and wail of her voice alone is glittering, flowing, moving, confident, and energetic.  It\'s something you can listen to over and over again and still be in awe.  It\'s a youthful girl screaming, "here I am, and I\'m overflowing with love!"The haunting thing about this, and her subsequent albums as well, is how far Alison runs from the illusions of pop music.  Even songs that were written for a 60\'s Motown troupe, or for the biggest pop group in history, become terribly authentic and heartbreakingly hers.  It\'s really hard not to fall in love with the girl.

But, three most important reasons for owning this collection are as follows - 1) "When You Say Nothing At All, 2) "Baby, Now That I\'ve Found You", and 3) "I Don\'t Believe You\'ve Met My Baby"...all three songs are examples of why I would consider Alison Krauss as one of the finest interpreters of a song I have ever heard.  She adds emotional depth to the Louvin Brothers classic, and. she re-invents a bubblegum hit into a song of true heartbreak, (and, in the process, creates one of the all-time great cover versions).  As for "You Say Nothing At All", it\'s one of the few songs that can almost always bring to tears due to the beauty of the performance.  I cannot heap enough praise on the song.  It has become one of my all-time favorite songs, and never fails to move me.  For those three songs alone, I would recommend this album.

Beginning on a familiar note with a cover of "Baby, Now That I\'ve Found You", the following track, "Oh, Atlanta" was what really served all the comfort and ease of macaroni and cheese that any bluegrass-country song should. In this ode to Atlanta, Georgia, Krauss slides and shouts through the notes and over a janky guitar accompaniment, while maintaining what many call an "angelic" voice. Not to be overlooked is the band she was invited to join early on in her career, Union Station. Adam Steffey on mandolin plays a plucky prelude to "Every Time You Say Goodbye", while Ron Block riffs on the banjo. The middle of the album blends together in a chorus of love sickness, but "When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart\' picks up the pace with a spirited stack of vocals. Krauss has help from Suzanne and Evelyn Cox--their voices are well suited together in this remarkably sultry rendition of a traditional. More pining, and then another familiar cover to end on, "When You Say Nothing At All", which I\'ll demurely admit I recognized from Notting Hill. As a compilation cd, half the tracks are memorable, while the other half are a little hazier. Since Krauss tends to sing a lot about lost love, it is no surprise that this collection would be comprised of songs with titles that include the words: "goodbye", "lonely", "teardrops", and "morning dew". Yet, there is some variety with "Oh, Atlanta" and "When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart", and heartsick or not, Krauss always delivers with a honey sweet voice.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Krauss Sings With A Honeyed Heart and Voice', 'unixReviewTime': 1284249600, 'reviewTime': '09 12, 2010'}

A televised performance at The Grand Ol Opry that I happened to catch whetted a mild appetite, and finally I bit the bullet and purchased this compilation of some of her best work in the latter 1980s and early 1990s.This little explanation was necessary because it illustrates a point made by Providence Phoenix writer Jim Macnie in the CD's liner notes - Alison Krauss and her Union Station bandmates are not the type of band who go looking for attention.  They prefer the cozier confines of smaller scale performances.  As a result, they have slipped under the general radars of country-pop and have fashioned a body of compellingly simple work, a small fraction of which is on display here.Macnie describes a humorous incident in New York where Ms. Krauss fretted about the bad hair night she had and how her forehead was showing.  With a lot of other chart-toppers, such an incident would become an exercise in self-absorption; with Alison Krauss it is just a throwaway episode.  Ms. Krauss' hair can certainly disarm the viewer as it does in its close-cropped short mane gracing the cover of her recent disc New Favorite, but bad hair days or not, it is the music that keeps the listener.Union Station does not employ a drummer, and the lack of such percussive backbone is no great loss.  The synergy of fiddle, dobro, banjo, and so forth enters the soul just fine, and Ms. Krauss becomes the soul with gracefully tender vocals that never become mushy or cloying.  On &quot;Every Time We Say Goodbye&quot; she takes a sad instance and makes a charming throwaway out of it, and repeats this throughout the twelve numbers culled here. Her cover of the cheesy 1960s hit &quot;Now That I Found You&quot; dispenses with that number's approach and instead crafts something so unexpectedly different that it makes the original easy to ignore.While Ms. Krauss may not become a chart-topper of the Martina McBride mold, she doesn't really have to try, since her music bears so much greater substance than most contemporary country-pop.

It isn't:  it's a retrospective of her career with a few wonderful new songs added as well.  It demonstrates her development as an artist and the wide range of her musical abilities.  Most of all, it is a truly enjoyable album.This album has sold over two million copies  and went to the top 15 of the pop music charts and number 2 on the country charts--which demonstrates that her music has wide appeal yet is hard to pigeonhole into one category.  Alison and her band Union Station have won a total of nine Grammy awards (so far) in at least three categories (country, bluegrass, and gospel)--and they're still going strong.  Yet, putting her into just those three categories still doesn't adequately describe her music:  she is truly a unique perform! er.Part of her uniqueness is that she's achieved her success just by being herself and doing it her way--rather than the usual commercialized way.  She is so down to earth in concert you feel like you are listening to her in a park with some friends or could ask her out for coffee afterwards without reservations.  She has not bought into the hype and commercialism of the modern music scene; I almost think she wouldn't care about the money, as long as she could still make the music she enjoys--and does SO well.She has the most angelic, passionate, and achingly lovely voice I've ever heard.  I frequently suffer from deep major depression, and Alison's singing is one of the few things that can still touch me in the midst of that.  Sometimes I will just play this album or a few special songs over and over and over again when I'm really down in the pit of despair and let Alison remind me there IS still beauty and joy in this world.This is an album I have giv! en many times as a gift, and it's always been well apprecia! ted.

Even if you've got all Alison's other albums, you'll need this.The set begins with a cover of the sixties pop hit, Baby now that I've found you. You may remember the original - a somewhat sad lyric but a very upbeat tune, which was a UK number one hit for the Foundations. Alison slows the song right down, in keeping with the lyrics.The final track is a cover of When you say nothing at all, recorded for Keith Whitley's tribute album. This is a song that has spawned a number of covers, including Irish versions by Boyzone (who had a big British hit with it) and Frances Black. Even Frances cannot improve on Alison's version.Between those two tracks are many other brilliant songs, including I will (from the Beatles' white album), Teardrops will kiss the morning dew (even better than the Billie Jo Spears version, which I think was the original) and the Lovin Brothers' I don't believe you've met my baby, later covered by Dolly on her Little sparrow album.The O brother soundtrack, the various O sister compilations inspired by it and Dolly Parton's recent albums have all helped to increase the popularity of bluegrass, but this compilation pre-dates all of them and it was hugely successful.

This compilation album includes three new songs as well as four others that only appeared on tribute albums (not on any of Alisons\' albums). Whether she\'s with her Union Station band or not, Krauss always hits on all cylinders. Her vocals are dynamic and emotional, yet soft and not over-the-top. She has a deep care for keeping her personality and distictiveness in the music, and one cannot overlook her great instrumental talent (fiddle). Tired of female vocalists substituting volume for emotion in their singing? You have come to the right place! Alison and her backing musicians will blow you away on this recording!The title track and *In The Palm of Your Hand* are wonderfull cover songs and Ms. Krauss\' bluegrass-pop reworking of *When You Say Nothing At All* is every bit as enjoyable as Keith Whitley\'s original. Also, listen for the country-blues instrumental work on *Oh, Atlanta* and *When God Dips His Pen of Love in My Heart*. My favorite Alison Krauss song is the lamenting *Everytime You Say Goodbye*. It has a beautiful melody that starts off with a bouncy mandolin and banjo and then slides into a rich fiddle solo. "And your words just are like arrows through my heart, everytime you say goodbye" is one of my favorite lyrics of all-time.The entire album is played to a light, if not non-existent percussion backbeat. Alison does a crafty job of refreshing bluegrassy music while blending in touches of pop and folk. Add in her top-notch vocals, unique phrasing and fiddling and you\'ve got an artist who has certainly carved out a niche of their own.

The band is also top notch as well as the entire collection of songs.  You may have heard the song &quot;When You Say Nothing At All&quot; often played on country music stations.  I wonder why that song and a genuine talent like Alison isn't topping the charts instead of the Celine Dions of the world.

She shows with this album that she has range, as a wide variety of song types has made its way onto this CD.1. Baby, Now That I've Found You: This has a pop sound of the 80's and still holds true to her bluegrass roots.  It reminds me of other pop songs of the time.2. Oh, Atlanta: By far my favorite track on this CD.  The quick bluesy, jazz sound is unique.  I have not heard very many songs with a sound like this one.3. Broadway:  A slower, more traditional country sounding song.  Not bad, but not a standout.4. Every Time You Say Goodbye: A true bluegrass sound, this song really stays true to her roots.  It has everything I like about bluegrass.5. Tonight I'll Be Lonely Too:  A very traditional country sound, reminiscent of the singers of Hank Sr.s' day.6. Teardrops Will Kiss the Morning:  Another oldie country sound.  The lyrics really don't do much for me, but Krausses voice helps carry this song for me.7. Sleep On:  This has the sound of what country will become, with some of the sound of the day mixed in.  I find it hard to dislike any song in which Krauss harmonizes.8. When God Dips His Pen of Love In My Heart:  Straight out of the gospel roots of bluegrass, it has the old-time church sound.  That is something I normally love, but this song doesn't really work for me.9. I Will:  This song is one of the definitions I use when explaining Krausses sound.  The pure, clean sounding vocals with touching lyrics is her hallmark, and what keeps me coming back.10. In The Palm of Your Hand:  Another of her classics, this song touches me.  It speaks to the queit southern religion of my youth.

"Now That I Found You: A Collection" is a compilation of Alison\'s early work along with some new music.  Even though she was only 23 when she released this CD in 1995, Alison had been recording since she was 16.  Her pure voice shines through, and the songs are consistently excellent; however, three of them are real standouts."Baby, Now That I\'ve Found You" is my favorite selection and simply one of the catchiest songs I\'ve ever heard.  Whenever I hear it, the tune gets imbedded into my mind and plays on a continuous loop for days.  The song was originally a #11 pop hit in 1968 for the Foundations, who are perhaps better known for "Build Me Up Buttercup."  It was only a minor country hit for Alison (#49 in 1995), although it netted her a Grammy for Best Country & Western Vocal Performance - Female.  "When You Say Nothing At All" is Alison\'s biggest country hit, having peaked at #3 in 1995.  What makes its success all the more amazing is that it was a #1 hit just seven years earlier for Keith Whitley.  It\'s clearly become one of Alison\'s signature songs.  The final standout for me is "I Will" written by those great bluegrass artists - Lennon and McCartney!  Only a tremendous talent like Alison could make a Beatles song into a bluegrass masterpiece.This CD was an unexpected hit - selling more than 2 million copies.  It also helped Alison win 3 major Country Music Association Awards in 1995 - Horizon (best new artist), Female Vocalist, and Single of the Year for "When You Say Nothing At All."  I\'m by no means an expert on bluegrass, and I admit that most of the bluegrass CDs I own feature Alison Krauss.
