The bevel adjustment lever is also very well placed and does not get in the way of the front handle although on my unit it is very tight and hard to move.  I like the fact that if you adjust to cut on a bevel angle the front handle will still be positoned in the level positon and will not intefere with the sight of the cutting line like the Dewalt DW364.  I mention the Dewalt DW364 because I would rate that unit equal in design.  The Milwaukee is much larger and in my estimation unbalanced.  It feels heavier then the weight stated.  Again the Dewalt feels more balanced and lighter even though it comes in at a slightly higher weight.  Also, on a bevel cut the Milwaukee is easy to see the line and the Dewalt almost hides the blade.  It is a toss up between these 2 units but if size, weight and balance are a consideration I would chose the Dewalt.  If features are a factor I would chose the Milwaukee. After saying all that I kept the Milwaukee because they are minor issues to me and this unit outclasses any other unit I have compared it or the Dewalt with.  Also at a price savings over the Dewalt I felt this was a great bargain for a high end company.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great product', 'unixReviewTime': 977097600, 'reviewTime': '12 18, 2000'}

I've made shelving and cabinets using pine, cedar and oak. I've cut 2 by's for deck construction and ripped plywood for roof repair.  This saw is terrific.  It is powerful, solid without being excessively heavy, and very well balanced for a sidewinder.  Calibration marks are clear and accurate for depth of cut and baseplate angle.  Large adjustment lever and knob make these adjustments easy.  I've done a number of jobs requiring 45 degree bevel cuts.  If you've done this, you know how difficult it can be using a handheld curcular saw.  Well, I'm impressed with how accurate the gauge is and how easy it is to balance this saw to get perfect mitered corners.  The most remarkable feature is the Tilt-Lok.  I wasn't sure how often I would use this when I first considered buying this model, but I find I use it often and really like it.  It allows me to get just the right handle angle so that whether I'm making cuts on the ground, or kneeling on a roof, cutting above my head or using saw horses, I can find an angle where the handle and trigger feel just right and I'm in control.  Even without electronic braking, the wind-down interval is very brief.  The self storing wrench and spindle lock button eliminate a lot of fumbling during blade changes.  A few points to consider:  the blade that ships with this saw is for ripping, so plan on buying a couple more for cross cuts and fine finishing.  Also, you'll need a rip fence because Milwaukee doesn't include this vital accessory:Milwaukee Rip Fence Kit, Model# 49-22-4146.  Finally, the base plate is aluminum to keep the weight down, but the aluminum galls on some surfaces and leaves marks, so plan on putting some tape on the bottom to protect fine work pieces.

I took two years of autoshop which makes me the mechanic for the family fleet of vehicles...little did I know, think or imagine that one day I would have to take on the role as a builder/engineer/carpenter.  All of this was thrust upon me about a month ago when my wife decided she wanted to keep chickens in our backyard.  It was my job to somehow assemble a chicken coop for the chickens to live in.I\'ve got a cordless Ryobi saw that barely holds a charge that got me through some of the construction and I finally told my wife that we needed to invest in something better if this job was ever going to get done.  I read some reviews and decided to buy this saw from the local Home Depot.  I paid $10 more than what it\'s currently listed here for, but I didn\'t pay for shipping so it probably evens out.I have no doubts that this is a quality saw, however; I was a little disappointed that it wasn\'t actually MADE IN THE USA.  That\'s somewhat of a bummer.  The Tilt-Loc grip/handle is a neat feature but I haven\'t had any use for it quite yet.  It\'s actually a little bit of an effort to get the tilt-loc to move from position to position so I\'ve just got it set at the setting that will fit the darn thing into the box.  Others have mentioned this, but it bears repeating--The saw doesn\'t fit into the box unless the tilt-loc is in the very bottom position and the saw is set to 0 degrees cut / flat.  It took me probably 5+ minutes to figure out how to get the saw back into the box after I messed with the tilt-loc.  I\'m also a little skeptical of the tilt-loc action.  It kind of feels like if you were adjusting that on a regular basis that it\'s going to let go sooner rather than later and you\'re going to have a broken handle.  That assumption could be complete wrong but it\'s just the feeling I get after adjusting it myself.  It\'s all plastic, it feels nice but it also feels like it\'s a breaking point.With that out of the way, the saw is great.  It\'s been handling all of the tasks that I throw at it with ease.  Again, I\'m not a professional carpenter or anything so I can\'t speak to any shortcomings in the blade that comes with the saw, it works fine for what I\'ve been doing with it.  I\'ve made really nice cuts out 1/2" plywood, this thing eats through 2x4\'s like nobodys business...which is what I needed it for.I really hope and expect to have this saw for quite a long time.  That was the thought of spending the extra money on a good saw at this point in my life rather than buying lesser/cheaper saws and having to replace it down the line.  Though, if you do the math on it, the cheapest saw here on Amazon is around $50 or so, you could pick up 2 of these and still it\'d be cheaper than buying one Milwaukee.

(I also used to think any Craftsman that could spin a blade was OK, too...)I liked the rear pivot on the DeWalt, easier than adjusting the handle every time you move the blade.

(Never mind - the 6394 would be worth every dime).In the end there is really no comparison. The DeWalt's front-mounted depth-of-cut adjustment ruins the view of the blade; you have to lean forward to see your cut line. This saw is lighter, quieter, and feels better in your hand. Cutting depth and bevel markings are cast-in, not on decals that may wear off one day. If you need to cut up a floor you'll appreciate the flexibilty of the Tilt-Lok handle. The bottom line is the cutting - this saw makes wood feel like liquid. If you couldn't see and hear the Endurance blade doing its work, you wouldn't know you were cutting anything. It is absolutely effortless - turns wood to vapor. I even swapped the stock blades between the two saws, and while the DeWalt blade is relatively garbage, this saw cuts like a monster either way.If you never try the Milwaukee, you'll be perfectly happy with whatever you like now.

There is no way of adjusting this parameter and therefore no real way of tuning the saw.I realize that this is likely just my particular unit but it was clearly a deal breaker for me.  I have to say, Amazon was very helpful and they offered me a full cash return without even charging for return shipping.  This, despite being a week or so outside the 30 day window of their official return policy.  They understood that I'd been having problems with the saw from the start but didn't identify the problem until later.I gave this saw 3 stars rather than 1 simply because my experience is probably the exception.  It's obvious from the reviews that many users are very satisfied with it and I don't wish to be a major outlier.My next purchase will undoubtedly be for a saw with an adjustable cant.", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': "Blade isn't parallel to side of shoe", 'unixReviewTime': 1320192000, 'reviewTime': '11 2, 2011'}

Petersen "jjpeter"', 'helpful': [21, 25], 'reviewText': 'I just started using this saw (I purchased the lefthand 6391) to complement my lefthand Skil 5510 5-1/2" Circular Saw. My old (20 years) 7-1/4" Skil saw was overdue for replacement. Even though I use my 5-1/2 for most of my cutting, I need a 7-1/4 now and then for heavier work like cutting 4x stock. Here are my impressions of the Milwaukee 6391.Good -1-Surprising light weight for a 7-1/4. The magnesium\\aluminum\\plastic housing makes this unit the lightest 7.25s I have handled. And I checked all the major brands at home depot, hefting each in turn.2- First class construction. Every component of this machine is precision. The aircraft aluminum shoe is a marvel to behold. Much better then the stamped steel some others use. The depth of cut release mechanism is the best I have seen. Big grabbable handle that smoothly releases the shoe. Ditto on the bevel release, both easy on the fingers and they lock down with confidence. I really like the grab handle at the front of the saw. Its grippy-rubber covered and fits the hand perfectly. The magnesium housing around the top of the blade looks cool and give this saw an impressive look. The adjustable handle is a clear break-through in saw design. Its a brilliant innovation and I\'m surprised no other manufacturer thought of this before. It lets you set the angle your hand engages the tool with. So whether you are working material below your knees or even overhead, you have eight settings to chose from. I\'m still experimenting with the settings, but with this saw, you have a choice. I really like the rubberized handle too. No more slipping out of a sweaty palm.3- Power. I\'m working with salvaged fir timbers this month, all 4x and this old wood is hard and tough. The 6391 just powers through without slowing at all! Even the full 4"x12" beams are no match for the powerful motor on the machine. I have to flip the timbers to cut all the way through them and the resulting cuts are square and smooth, and I\'m doing these free hand, without a 90 degree helper-square. The blade that came with the saw is good, a 16 point carbide tipped one. When it starts to dull I\'ll switch over to a Freud TK203 7-1/4" 24-Tooth Thin Kerf.4- Case. The saw comes with a LARGE red carry case. It will hold extra extension cords and other pliable items if desired.Negative - Very little here.1- The depth of cut guage is set on the inside of the saw housing and its hard to see. The marking are in 1/4" increments, which is how much blade you want pertruding from below the work surface but the numbers are not easy to read. The Ryobi 7.25 had a very good depth guage setup, the best of all the ones I looked at at HD.2- No blade brake. Some of the high end saws have this feature, I\'m not sure why Milwaukee left this out. Maybe to save on weight. It would be a "nice to have."2a- An update on the blade brake feature.  The "right hand" model, the 6394, has the blade brake.  I found this out from the Milwaukee web site.  No plans to offer this feature in the "lefty" model though (I wrote them).  You do lose a 1/4 horse of power on the 6394; maybe thats the trade off.  I\'d rather have the power to be honest.This is a great circular saw. If you use one of these tools on a regular basis, or if you are just a now-and-then user but like to have the best tools, get this one.

This is one powerful, tough, saw. As a remodeling contractor I am very hard on tools and this saw can take the abuse.  I have owned several other circular saws and this is easily my favorite.  I also have the Porter Cable blade on left which I have used the last 3 years. I like the Porter Cable and I love the visibility of the blade on left, but it always feels out of balance in my hand since I am right-handed, and when setting up cuts you often find that the majority of the saw's shoe and weight is being supported by the off cut side, because the blade on left is meant for left handers.The Milwaukee 6390 has solved this problem.  It is extremely well balanced and the design of the blade opening in the shoe allows for excellent visibility of the cut line from above the saw. As a right hander you do not need to lean over the saw to see your cut line. Some guys are in such a habit of doing just that, and it is a hard habit to break.  I have pointed out to them how you can easily see the cut line from above and they always comment on how great that is.The bevel adjustment handle is large and sturdy and easy to adjust.  Bevel cuts on this saw are the best I have ever experienced.  It will cut bevels up to 51 degrees or so like butter.  No bogging or binding whatsoever.Two minor complaints that Milwaukee should address is that the shoe has a little bump on the edge at each corner, so that if you are using a straight edge like a speed square as a cutting guide, those little bumps will cause you to not get a perfectly square cut. To solve this I just filed them off. The other thing is that I did not like the thin kerf blade that came with the saw.  I put on a heavy duty carbide framing blade and the saw cuts much smoother, and quieter.  I get perfectly square cuts now, and this thing will go through a stud so smoothly it feels like 1 X .Despite its minor flaws the Milwaukee is still deserving of 5 stars especially when you start comparing other saws.  The Porter Cable is a close second in my book, but the combination of balance, power, control, and adjustments of the Milwaukee make it my top choice.

I am not using a skill 77 any more, or even the Porter Cable 743.  In fact I switched from a left bladed worm to a right blader  just to get the toughness and power that this Milwaukee saw has.  The first  guy to review this saw (conceptbydesign) hit the nail on the head when he  said this saw was tough.  There are many well-designed features on this saw  but the best thing is the power and toughness.Another great  feature is the fact that if you set this saw to a shallow cutting depth,  the handle stays where it belongs or where you want it to be - down near  the work -- instead of getting way up in the air where it\'s hard to  control.  Also, the blade guard handle is back off the shoe where it\'s  easy and safe to grab.  Setting a bevel on this saw is a dream.  The  markings are clear and the lock comes easy to the hand.  On some saws the  shoe is thin and "bendy" or too narrow.  This one is almost perfect.Now a circular saw is probably the second most personal tool a  carpenter will own right after a hammer.  I wouldn\'t be surprised if every  saw here on Amazon got five stars, because everyone likes something a  little different with their saws.  You have to decide which features are  right for you.  There are almost more opinions about which saw is better  than there are saws.  That\'s why I used a 77 for 30 years without changing.  But the first time I pulled the trigger on this saw it was clear that the  sheer power was going to make for accurate cuts and pleasant work.  This is  also one of the lightest saws there is - at least amongst the beefy framing  saws.  It was time for a change.  No saw is perfect - here are the gigs:  This saw is a bit noisy.  It has a good blade guard but it still would be  nice to have a blade brake.  Maybe someday Milwaukee will read this and  make one that has a left blade.

It has the power and heft to cut anything a mere man can push it through. I particularly like the tilting handle which allows great ergonomics regardless of the height the saw is being used. The seven and a half pound weight is amazing when you consider this saw has more power than most push mowers. The blade that comes with it is good and the wrench works ok too. I really love the long cord made of rubber that allows one to cut a full sheet of ply length wise with out plug hang up. The only bone I have to pick with the saw's engineers is the base plate. Although it is true to the blade and thick enough to resist bending even if dropped, its edge is too thin. This edge tends to dive under long guides it follows for straight cuts. If it had a ninety degree bend, or some added thickness along the long edges of the shoe, I think that would solve that problem. I also have a Hitachi sidewinder and its nickel plated cast aluminum base is thick at the edges and follows long guides much easier.

Comfortable to pick up and get to work, but not the kind of tool to set down or store carelessly due to the aluminum shoe easily bending.Saw does get up to speed a bit slow, and it does throw sawdust around. It helps to practice a bit and to use the sharpest, finest blade you can for the work at hand. It's tempting to let the motor do all the work, but stick with good sense and let the proper blade do the work.I generally enjoy the saw and have a great deal of confidence in it getting the work done. I would give it a higher review, but it's not a tough tool, just a good one.If it lasts a few years, I'll be happy at this price - although I would have paid extra for a detachable cord and a rip fence to be included in the giant red box...", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Comfortable, but not heavy duty....', 'unixReviewTime': 1194739200, 'reviewTime': '11 11, 2007'}

Barnhart', 'helpful': [4, 4], 'reviewText': 'I am a guy who bought an old 1900 house and didn\'t know anything whatsoever about carpentry a couple of years ago, so my \'review\' should be taken with that in mind.  But after buying this place, we decided that new cabinets were essential and after going to Home Depot and seeing the overpriced junk they have there, I decided that even at my worst I could do better than that.  I spent several months acquiring the tools necessary for cabinetry but given that my shop space is extremely tight, I was eventually faced with the dilemma of cutting down full sheets of 3/4" ply without the space to do so on my table saw.  I did some reading and figured that the Eurekazone EZ-Smart system w/a good circular saw would be a good way to go and went about researching just which circ saw would best suit my needs.  If you\'re like me, and you\'re researching the myriad options out there, and banging your head against the wall trying to decide which one to spend your hard-earned dough on, I honestly think your search is over.  Without getting into a lot of elaborate detail, with a decent Freud blade and the EZ guide system, I\'m cutting down 3/4" sheets of Armor Core cherry ply with NO, and I mean NO, tearout.  Super, super, clean cuts, that are every bit as good as what I\'m getting on my table saw.  The only real disadvantage of the Circ saw rig compared to the Tablesaw is the setup time.  The cut quality is every bit as good.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Super clean, accurate, and easy - nay - a pleasure to handle.', 'unixReviewTime': 1277510400, 'reviewTime': '06 26, 2010'}
