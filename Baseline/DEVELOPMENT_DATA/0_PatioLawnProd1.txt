This American made tool (made in USA or U.S.A.) was designed to last. This axe is lightweight but can easily cut through both wet and dry hard woods. The molded handle is surely the most comfortable I\'ve ever felt on an axe. This very portable axe is what you are looking for if you want to fell trees, split wood or re-split firewood into kindling. However, I wouldn\'t attempt to use this axe to smack a wedge through big logs. It is light enough to use one-handed for hammering pegs etc. I\'m assuming that it\'s by no coincidence that the longer version of this axe also has a rounded handle segment in the middle that you can "choke up" on to gain better control of the swing for hammering or for close cutting/hewing; it is light and controllable. Although none is shown in the picture, mine came with a leather sheath; all of the ones I\'ve seen in stores do. It comes with a sharp factory edge and sharpens to a ridiculously sharp edge in a few passes from one of those V-shaped knife/tool sharpenersAccu Sharp 060 GardenSharp Tool Sharpener(Accusharp).

WHY I BOUGHT THIS ONE in the first place, BUT... now the bad. I need this to process wood, to make ready for a real camp fire on many occasions, not just a once in a year deal to tackle a shrub in the back yard that over grown scissors might be able to. By process wood, I mean, after a chain saw has bucked up a tree into small rounds, the splitting comes next, and so the need of a good axe for rounds from 3&#34; up to 12&#34;, so not very large.I bought from reviews, I guess from people that are not aware, all of them, of very small details in axe head profiles that make ALL the difference in making spitting go very easy, even enjoyable, to a hard slug, and an exhausting needless WORKOUT :( ! A splitting axe head which a lot of people said they were happy using this axe for in the reviews, this axe is NOT.To SPLIT the axe head MUST be more CONVEX from edge to back of head, on the side. This causes the wood to actually &#34;SPLIT&#34; without also wedging the axe head into the wood, which this axe profile does EVERY TIME it does not carry through the round, which is very often I am afraid.To CHOP or FALL trees, I guess this axe WOOD be OK... It DOES HAVE a CONCAVE HEAD profile from edge to back of the head.. which makes for a axe head that sinks DEEP into the wood without causing much splitting at all, as well as the WORST PART, trying to UNWEDGE a fully sunk axe head from a round of wood. Now just try that on every chop on a round, 4 times per round, 20 -30 round per fire, say three times a week... lets just say I am back to using a $20.00 special garbage axe, that just has the right head profile that gets the split done almost EVERY time, only bad about a cheap axe, is the steel in the head is poor, won't hold an edge for long. I AM LOOKING TO FIND THAT QUALITY PERFECT AXE ONCE AGAIN!! PLEASE ANY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE APPRECIATED!! NON WOOD HANDLES WITH HIGH END STEEL HEADS PREFERRED.I gave three stars because BEST WARRANTY, tough built, high quality steel is used, with a nice finish, and one of the BEST head cases I have. All their axes come with these. The ONLY PURPOSE I see for this axe is a lager version than a hatchet to take on a boat trip, 4x4 camp trip, etc, to just chop down trees, saplings, etc.. forget the splitting unless you need and want the extra exercise. ALL of their axes (3 sizes, mini hatchet, 16&#34; hatchet, and the E45A Axe) have this SAME head profile flaw, most unfortunately, or else my axe buying days would be over!

First thing to note is that the blade is thiner that other axes this allows much deeper cuts than would be normaly possibe for a medium sised axe. If you have a strong practiced swing, a 5 inch tree can be felled in two whacks. I have tackled trees up to 3 feet in diameter.It does take more time that a full sise logging axe but the task is not much more dificlt than it would be normaly, thanks to the light weight and powerful cutting blade. The steel is very high quality and dulls slowly. I have only had to sharpen mine 2 times in 6 years.(both times after overcutting into rocks or metal)  As with all axes I own I throw this axe. It rotates well and will hold up to the fource of bad hits. occationaly the shaft just below the head will bend slighlty if the impact (when thrown) is very severe. IE hitting a log sidewase half way down the handle. but just take it whack it on the same objet in the other direction and it straightens right back out.  I have Abused this axe severly in the last year or so because I want a prettier one.(mine is very scrached and stained). I CANNOT break it.  I have managed to get the bottom of the soft rubber handle to come appart from it hitting trees and targets handle first but nothing else has broken.  The Blade will Nick and flatten if you hit rocks or metal but cleans up nicly on a grinder or with a dremmle.

The axe was on backorder for a couple weeks but I was informed of the status of my order several times during my wait.  I am very glad I purchased this axe.  I have used a half axe about this size about 45 years ago and found them very handy when camping and at Boy Scout Camp. Full sized axes were just too big for most scouts.  If they used them they worked themselves to death and would stop.  Then you couldn't get them to help again.  Of course this was when scouts could use axes and sheath knives.  I still have a couple full size axes but wanted to see if these were still as easy to use as I remember.  This is a great tool and is of the highest quality.First, the sheath is old school and made of beautiful thick tooled leather.  The sheath is heavily stitched and has strong rivets and double snaps.  The fit is snug and a very safe way to transport the axe.  It is well tanned but was a little dry so the first thing I did was to wipe it down with neatsfoot oil.  I recently saved a old leather sheath for a 18 &#34; machete that had been in a shed for twenty years with neatsfoot oil it took weeks but it is restored to almost perfect condition.  You don't see much neatsfoot oil around today.The axe blade is beautiful and just the right size for my uses now. The edge was rolled a little when I checked it but with a few licks across a steel that was cleared up.  I can use this thing without killing myself.  I can even use it with one hand if need be.  The stainless was very smooth and well brushed to a medium shine.  The shaft appear to go all the way through the handle.  I can't guarantie that it goes all the way through the handle but if is like several of my other Estwing tools it does.  The grip is designed to absorb vibrations and does so very well.  If it last as well as my others I will be passing this down to my grandson with the other Estwing tools.I would not carry this if I was backpacking but think it will be the best general camp tool that you can have if you like an evening fire.  Now if I was in a Zombie invasion I think this would just about be the perfect tool/weapon.  It has enough wight to pierce a skull but not so much weight to cause you to over swing wasting time and energy.I would recommend this axe from this dealer in a skinny minute and if I needed another I would have no second thoughts about its quality.

From the second it was received from UPS it has seen heavy usage, for that very day i began felling an entire two trees that had fallen into our yard weeks ago with no help, no other axes or saws, just me and the Estwing.  The Estwing is a brutal axe.  It has heavy recoil per swing and its all metal handle absorbs virtually none of the reprocution.  The rubber like handle is also unforgiving if you do not wear gloves.  The handle has so much grip that after an hour of swinging it will tear the skin off your hands.  The blade was actually quite sharp and i was able to continue chopping through the trees.  However, half way through the first tree i noticed the bend in the axe, it was small then but got worse faster and faster.  By the time i got through the first tree the axe's frame started bowing like a bracket symbol which is (.  Im not kidding.  By not even half the second tree the axe was pretty much unusable.  It had bent so bad it was more of a boomerang than an axe anymore.  I then bought a cheap Ames axe a week later to chop the rest of the tree and that $20 Wallmart axe has seen 10x the work the Estwing has since then and is still in heavy use.  I cannot fathom all the 5 star reviews for this Axe.  It has no recoil absorbtion, it hurts your hands without gloves and it definitely WILL NOT ''outlast your grand children''.

I think it comes all the way down the handle which is rubber coated and the leather sheath has slits on the back to strap it to a pack. If you are tall you could carry it on your belt I guess. Besides getting fire wood this axe will chop down doors.If your house is not made of brick you could probably chop your way in or out of an exterior wall.I did read some of the reviews here and read some of the complaints about inconsistant quality, and inspected 8 different makes of this axe and chose the cleanest one. After looking at the imperfections on some of these axes, I don\'t think it was from the manufacturing part of estwing but maybe how the axes were being stored at the store or in the way the axes were shipped. I also do not think the small nicks and scratches would have effected the performance of the axe either.I believe the actual blade is wider than the others.Update- I would not purchase this axe if you are planning to split thick logs or try to carry it into the woods. This axe is great for demo work and smaller tree stuff but it does not compare well to a real forged axe head with a hickory handle if considering to carry into the woods. The axe is great if you are working on trees or logs thinner than the blades edge and great for anything 3 inches thick or less. But If you go thicker than the blades edge it gets stuck a lot. Getting more axe experience, learning and developing more skills I now know why people spend the money on these Swedish axes.  The blade on this estwing from the edge to about the middle does not widen fast enough or does not have the right pitch. The blade digs deep, maybe too deep for it\'s own good and gets stuck often. On the Husqvarna forest axe that I bought, the blade gets thicker quicker so it does much more damage when striking and the tree or log and it does not squeeze back on the blade. Also I can get my hands really close to the bottom of the blade to do feathering or scraping work. The Husqvarna forest axe is what I bought to carry. Has the same length from top to bottom and was only 65 bucks. It is also lighter and you will use less energy with it than this axe to get more work done. Hard to find. it would still be worth it to buy a wetterlings or a granfors bruks.
