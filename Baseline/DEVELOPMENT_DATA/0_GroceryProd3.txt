This morning I compared their #6 white and Natural Brown cone paper filters (not the bamboo brown) to see for myself if there was any difference in the flavor of the coffee (they don't make a #6 filter in the bamboo brown).  It was a tightly controlled experiment if I do say so myself, i.e. I was careful about water and coffee amount being the same, brewing time and method identical, etc.  The surprising result was that the coffee was much more flavorful with the Natural Brown filter.  The coffee was heartier, more full-bodied and more natural tasting, as if more of the essence of it got through the filter (although of course no grounds did).  I was not expecting this and thought beforehand that I probably wouldn't be able to tell a difference.  But there was a lot of difference.

No cholesterol in coffee itself, but they suspect that some component of the coffee hits your gut and triggers your body to make more cholesterol. I kid you not. Google it.So someone recommended &#34;pour over&#34;, and so we tried one of the little #4 filters. Tasted great!

I find the system more convenient than coffee machines.If the power goes off, you can still make coffee if you have a gas stove or a camp stove.It is easy to brew exactly the amount of coffee you want, and exactly the strength that you want---including adjusting to new roast and grinds.  You can even mix caffeinated and decaffeinated coffees if you wish.  I often re-use the morning\'s grinds in the afternoon, by adding a spoon of decaffeinated coffee.  That is not recommended with an automatic coffee machine---because if you clog up the filter, the boiling water could overflow.  No problem clogging up a Melitta filter, if it drains slowly, then pour slowly.In a way, the Mellita system is more "sanitary".  It is easy to forget a used filter in a coffee maker, maybe for weeks if you go on a vacation, and find a fungus garden in there.  You can\'t ignore a used Melitta filter, because it is out in the open.  If you forget a used Melitta filter, it and the coffee grinds just dry out.Although most people use smaller Mellita filters and cones, I prefer the large #6 system.  The #6 system (filters, cone, and caraf) is intended for brewing 4-8 cups at a time.  However, the larger filter holds more water, and it drains faster, so you can brew 2 cups of coffee with a #6 filter faster than with a #4 filter.  So the #6 system is faster and more flexible, at a very slightly higher cost for the filters.If you grind your own coffee, the water (for 1-2 cups) is almost boiling by the time you\'ve set up the filter, ground the coffee, and put away the coffee grinder.  A #6 filter actually holds the water for about 2 cups of coffee, but drains so fast that pouring 4-8 cups of water through just takes perhaps 10--15 seconds.  The corresponding #6 glass carafe is marked for up to 8 cups, but obviously it takes longer to boil the water for 8 or so cups of coffee.It\'s as simple as it gets, the price of the filters is cheap, and the quality of the results as terrific.  What else could you want?Presumably, brown filters are easier on the environment---and on you, less chemicals having been used to manufacture them.The specific Amazon product is probably the cheapest way to purchase the preferred filters.NOTEIt is important to take care to pour the boiling water into the filter, not between the filter and the filter cone.  It is any easy accident  to make.  To minimize such accidents, fold over the "joined" edges of the filters so that the filter opens wider.  If you are a particular klutz, a quick rinse with a little cold water before you add the coffee can "glue" the filter to the cone.Recommendation:  After major grocery shopping expeditions, sit down at your computer with your receipt, and check if you can buy any of the non-perishables through Amazon.  When you find items (even if more expensive than you just paid), put the item on your Amazon wish list, and add a note to the wish list of the price you just paid.  Check your wish list frequently, and when you see an item you need at a bargain price, buy it.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Mellita Coffee System', 'unixReviewTime': 1262822400, 'reviewTime': '01 7, 2010'}
