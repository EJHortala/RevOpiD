The vaporized water is eventually all sucked out and you are left with a chunk of ice cream that has everything in it but water. Note, it doesn't melt.

It is not cold, melty, real ice cream, so don't expect that.  It feels like a very light meringue block when you pull it out of the wrapper, and once you pop it in your mouth it has a creamy texture and ice cream-like flavor.
