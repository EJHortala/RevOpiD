Very deceiving since the comments here say the same for all maps, and mention that it is laminated.When we got the map in the shipping tube, as soon as we pulled it out, we noticed the ends had crumpled and that the middle had to crinkle marks that are across the whole map. Not sure if this is from shipping (since the tube was in fine shape), or from when the map was rolled with the shipping paper.The map itself is a beautiful print with great detail and is the only reason we're keeping it.Overall slightly disappointed.

I highly recommend it!  The price is less than on the maker\'s website, and it arrived in 2 days thanks to Amazon Prime.  The map has a nice heavy lamination on front and back and it arrived in perfect condition, rolled, wrapped in a custom plastic sleeve, and shipped inside a very sturdy cardboard tube with packing material in the end of the tube.  We have unwrapped and rerolled it twice now, putting it back in the tube easily each time.  Now we want to have it framed with foamboard behind it and without glass, to use pushpins to show our travels. Our only question at this point relates to the custom framing, and we will follow up here when we see how that works out.  The framer (at Hobby Lobby) thinks it should be dry-mounted, since there will not be glass to hold the map flat, and they don\'t have mats large enough for it, but they expressed concern about the success of dry-mounting it because of the lamination.  We are trying to get advice/feedback from different sources regarding the framing, but if we do not get that, we expect to proceed with trying the dry-mounting since the map is so inexpensive , especially compared to the cost of framing it, and we could buy a replacement if the heat of the dry-mount process ruins the laminated map.  It appears the map is also available without lamination directly from National Geographic, so that is a possibility if we have to replace it, but I prefer buying through Amazon and love the price here.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Beautiful Map, Beautiful Addition to Home Office Wall', 'unixReviewTime': 1349740800, 'reviewTime': '10 9, 2012'}

P.', 'helpful': [1, 1], 'reviewText': "I researched for a long time and settled on this map for two reasons:1) I like the projection. It uses the Winkel-Tripel projection, which is a fair compromise between accurate distances and accurate shapes. The one you see on Google Maps is the Mercator projection, which heavily distorts distances towards the top and bottom edges of the map. That said, no projection is perfect (you're mapping a sphere onto a rectangle -- there is no perfect conversion!), and I like what Nat Geo has chosen.2) It has a lot of information like city names and the four other maps at the corners. The population density one in particular provides a nice view of where are the population-dense areas. One problem might be that having so much data makes it a little hard to get a clear glimpse of country locations. On simpler maps, you have mostly just country name, so at a glance you can figure out who are neighbors and such. Central Europe here is packed with so many city names that it's hard to figure out who's where.Upon opening the map (which was wrapped in plastic and came in a nice elongated cuboid), my immediate problem was how fragile the lamination is. Unlike some maps I've had, the lamination here is very thin and I immediately wind up with some fold lines, which are very obvious at the edges of the map. Granted, I may have been a little clumsy. But you need to adjust your expectations and be exceptionally careful when handling the map.The map is very well-priced though, IMO, and it's hard to find other good maps at this price.
