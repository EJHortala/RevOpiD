I generally use it on my forehead and blend it in with fingers, but I can still see it sitting on top of my skin with a normal mirror. It's good for the under eye area, but I find that it takes some work to blend and if I have a particularly bad spot, the best way to cover it is to dab a bit directly on.", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Not bad, but not great', 'unixReviewTime': 1366934400, 'reviewTime': '04 26, 2013'}
