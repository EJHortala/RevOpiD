I purchased 5 of the full-size pads for my son over a year and a half ago and I think they are GREAT.  My 4-year old has slept in a full-size bed since he turned 2.  These pads really work (no leaks!), are comfortable and wash-up well.  I only have 2 complaints ... 1. the side-flaps aren\'t quite long enough to fully tuck under if you have a pillow-top mattress (although you can make it work if one side of the bed is against the wall and you pull the opposite side really tight)  AND  2. the top and bottom of the pad tend to "curl up" after several washings.  Despite these complaints, I have not been able to find a pad that is even near the quality and comfort of this one.  The reason that I own 5 of these is that, if you truly want "full" coverage on the bed for a child that rolls all over while sleeping, you need to use 2 with some slight overlap (so, 2 to use and 2 for back-up).  I also use one (full-size) on the Spinmaster Flip-Open Sofa to keep spills and accidents from staining the sofa.  The full-size fully covers the full-length of the sofa.  I think this is a "must have" product for parents of toddlers that don\'t want to be constantly changing bed sheets or trying to "wash" a children\'s sofa that really isn\'t meant to be washed.(fyi ... If you like Basic Comfort\'s Ultimate Crib Sheet, then you\'ll also like their Handy\'s Plus Pad.  The Handy\'s Plus Pad is basically the Ultimate Crib Sheet with side flaps and without the snaps.  In fact, the pad portion of the Handy\'s Plus Pad - Full size is almost the same size as the Ultimate Crib Sheet.)', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': "Best and Most Comfortable WATERPROOF Pad I've found ...", 'unixReviewTime': 1167436800, 'reviewTime': '12 30, 2006'}
