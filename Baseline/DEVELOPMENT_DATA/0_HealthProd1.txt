This light is a nice touch and easy to use.  If you want it on just pull the lens out a bit.  It is focused very close to the center of what you will be look at and provides nice, even coverage.What I didn't like was the brightness (actually dimmness) of the light and where it is focused.  LEDs can be lots brighter, I know as I've seen them.  Also, the light focuses at the center of you field of view but only when the lens is too close to be focused properly.Bottom line is this is a good value for a magnifier and could have been made great with better quality control.BTW, I feel that honest, effective reviews can take the place of first-hand experiences that are lacking in online shopping.

You could certainly find your way to your house door in the dark or find something that you've dropped or even change a flat tire at night using the light (in a pinch).  At the same time, the light is not overly bright, so using the magnifier plus light to read a menu in a dark restaurant can be done without disturbing others.My one gripe about the magnifier is that it doesn't come with a protective pouch.  Ideally, a small microfiber cloth pouch should be included to both protect and clean the lens.  I suspect that if the unprotected magnifier were kept (for instance) in a purse or backpack or desk drawer for convenience, the lens could easily become so scratched over time by other objects as to lose some of its clarity.  What would it cost to add a microfiber pouch?  Not much at all (probably pennies for the manufacturer).  I'd pay an extra dollar or two for this magnifier with a pouch included.  I think the LightWedge folks missed the mark with that omission in packaging.For a pouch, it's easy and inexpensive enough to purchase a microfiber eyeglasses/sunglasses pouch, but those are typically larger (longer, wider and deeper) than needed for such a small magnifier.  We decided so sew our own from a 6x6-inch square microfiber cloth, adding a drawstring to the top. I'm sure that will increase the usable life of the magnifier and provide a ready-made way of keeping the lens clean as well.I'm tempted to give the magnifier only 4 out of 5 stars for the lack of inclusion of a pouch/protector/cleaner (an omission that I'm convinced could easily shorten the usable life of the lens), but I like the lighted magnifier so much as it is that it gets 5 stars from me.Update July 6, 2014:  Still a great little magnifier for the price -- but only at the price I paid for it of a little less than $9.  At the current price I see today of about $25 (with the current seller), I'd say it's not a good deal at all.
