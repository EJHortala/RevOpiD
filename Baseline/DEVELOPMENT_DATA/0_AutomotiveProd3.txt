As it turns out, the suction cup is larger than I expected.  The diameter of the suction cup measures just under 5" or about the diameter of a grapefruit.  Unfortunately, this puller couldn\'t remain sucked onto the dented panel because the surface of the panel wasn\'t flat enough.  As a result, all edges of the suction cup couldn\'t make contact, and the puller couldn\'t get a good enough seal to remain suctioned to the panel, allowing me to pull out the dent.  When I purchased this, I was expecting the suction cup to be smaller, which I think would have made it more likely I could find a section of the dent that was flat enough to get a good seal.I\'m going to have to send this back.  I\'m giving it five stars, though, because the build quality looks to be good (the handle is metal, and the rubber is thick and appears to be of good quality).  I\'m sure this would work well with the right shape of dent.  Before purchasing, I recommend you find a cup or jar with an opening that is just under 5" in diameter, and place it on the dent you have.

So, I came online looking for something a little cheaper to repair damages myself. First, I had my eye on the glue dent puller but after some reviews I looked a little further and ran across this product. The reviews looked good and it was a lot cheaper than the glue puller so I ran with it. I received the package in a timely manner and in great condition in its original packaging and Northern Tool & Equipment even sends a huge catalog of products with your order so you get to see all their cool little gadgets, prices aren't bad either. Anyway I pulled the big dent out of my car with 1 tug and did my best with the other. With a little determination and the right placing I pulled the whole thing out pretty well. This thing saved me $1,470.00 I could have wasted at a body shop.

The tank is back to 100% now.A few points/clarifications:A couple of reviews claimed that there was not enough suction to make this device effective.  I suspect that these people were not able to create an effective seal with the puller during application.  I\'m a 36 year old, extremely athletic man who works out on a daily basis.  I had to brace the bike with one arm while pulling with nearly all of my strength in order to pop the suction device off of my tank.I found that the key was to pull SLOWLY and straight back.  When doing so, the seal that creates the suction is not broken prematurely by lateral/vertical forces and you can attain a tremendous amount of pulling power.The dent on my tank was very shallow and uniform.

I'm sure as a glass carrying tool it would be very effective, but unless you've got 5 inch diameter of flat surface to adhere it to, it's not going to stick.  I could adhere it to my car door or my trunk lid, but could not get it to stick to any part of the dent on my bumper even after trying for over a half an hour.  I was so frustrated I almost took a rubber mallet to it to see if making the dent even bigger would help, but I had enough sense not to try it.So for me, it was totally useless and $20 down the drain. If someone ever sits on the hood of my car, or if I ever have a large pane of glass to carry, I'm sure it will come in handy.  For what I bought it for it was worthless.", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Needs a large flat surface to work', 'unixReviewTime': 1312588800, 'reviewTime': '08 6, 2011'}

The instructions aren\'t terribly good, but there is really only one way you can use the device. It should be obvious, once you get it in your hands.2. This won\'t fix paint damage. Rather, it will just pop dents back out.3. I think this is likely to work better for larger dents (like my 3" one) than for smaller nicks.
