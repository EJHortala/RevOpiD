Its been a real workhorse, and though I\'ve had trouble with other HP printers after a few years of use, I have nothing to complain about with this one. Trouble is, HP considers this too old (Win 95 era), and it\'s tough to find original replacement toner cartridges for it. You can buy cartridges that are remanufactured, re-filled, etc. and they are cheap, but quality is very "iffy". So I was happy to find this brand-new cartidge in origiinal packaging, and it works great. I know, I know; for the price of this new cartridge, I could have bought one of the cheap low-line laser printers brand new, but I would still need to buy a cartridge for them anyway (since they only come with "starter" toner), and the quality of these printers, while generally faster, is not as good as the old HP!
