We use a dehydrator, meat setting, use the Nesco piping tool, and it takes about 18 hours to make a great batch of jerky.  We turn the sticks once, pat the oil off the sticks when we turn them.  Perfecto.  The only thing that might be better is if we build a smokehouse and do it the old-fashioned way.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Not as big a pain to use as some jerky seasoning packets', 'unixReviewTime': 1399075200, 'reviewTime': '05 3, 2014'}
