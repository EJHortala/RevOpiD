The disposable set was great in the beginning as it requires very less washing and that its great for travelling. But besides these 2 things, there is no other use. Various reasons:1) Nipple: The nipple does NOT fit any other bottle (wide or regular) out there among thousands of brands in the market. Even playtex does not make a regular bottle to fit this nipple!!Also, the 0-12 months nipple is not recommended for babies older than 6 months. What nipple do you give after that??2) Nipple retainer: Retainer lost its shape after hot water boiling. The 6oz. nurser could not retain a filled liner after some time leading to a major spill on the baby at 2am.3) Cost: It gets very costly after some time. You are buying liners worth 3 expensive bottles every month.In a nutshell: If you want to change to some other bottle or nipple (given that your baby is already trained on the playtex disposables), you have to teach the baby all over again to get used to another nipple first. Basically, you are STUCK with playtex. PLAYTEX SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF A BETTER DESIGN OR AT LEAST GIVEN AN OPTION OF A REGULAR BOTTLE FOR DISPOBALE NIPPLES. I am very displeased by selecting playtex for my daughter. If you want to save yourself the hassle of burst liners on your baby or be cost conscious, look elsewhere.FYI: I know 2 other moms who are going through the same problem.', 'overall': 1.0, 'summary': 'A very frustrated and stressed out first time mom', 'unixReviewTime': 1020297600, 'reviewTime': '05 2, 2002'}

I'll start with the reasons why I like it.  It comes with your 4oz. and 8oz. bottles with a variety of nipples to choose from.  The disposable bags and drop-ins already come with.  These make your baby less gassy because you can push the air out.  They are really easy to warm.  You just run them under your faucet. They are also easy to clean. Now let me tell you my dislikes.  The drop-in refills or the bags are kind of pricy when you have to buy a new box 2-3 times a month.  They may give you a variety of nipples, but you can't even use them all in the beginning stages.  Some are marked infant and some older child.  The ones that are for the older children have too much of a flow coming out and would cause chocking with a younger baby.  Then they only give you like one infant nipple so you have to go out and buy more nipples anyway.  I'd recommend buying one separately to see if you like it first before commiting yourself to an entire box.

With it I could try several different nipples, which is what I really think was the reason my son refused the Avent bottles.At first we gave my son the orthodontic nipple since it was similarly shaped like his preferred pacifier (he also didn't like the Avent pacifiers, he would push them right out).  He thought it was okay, but still wasn't very enthusiastic about eating.  Next we tried the latex Natural Latch nipple and he went to town.  He now guzzles down his bottles with no problem.  And he has less gas now.  I think the collapsible liners make a big difference.  And even though generic plastic liners do a decent enough job, I don't mind spending a little more on the Playtex Drop-ins because they are less of a hassle.I would highly recommend this set.

HOWEVER, the way her lips formed around the nipple caused her bottom lip to curl up under it, and anyone who is an experienced breastfeeder knows that in order to have a good latch-on at the breast, your baby's bottom lip needs to curl OUT, not in.  This in turn caused me to have sore nipples when I was nursing her. There is nothing you can do to change how a baby sucks on a Playtex nipple; that is how they are designed.  It has taken taken considerable effort to reteach her how to latch-on, and even now (after four months) she still occasionally will turn in her bottom lip while she is nursing.  (I introduced this bottle at FIVE months, and she had always had a good latch-on from day one.)  I highly recommend (if you are a breastfeeding mother and wish to supplement, for example) using Avent - the nipple is shaped like your natural nipple and is designed to simulate nursing.

It's worked pretty well, although there are three big issues we have with it.1. If you aren't filling the bags completely full, then you have to collapse them after putting the nipple on to get rid of excess air.  If, like us, you are only putting in 2 oz at a time, this is a royal pain.  If you have to put the bottle down for a minute, say to adjust positions, check for poop, or wipe your newborn's chin, then air gets sucked back in through the nipple, and you have to press it out before feeding again.  Neither my fingers nor my wife's are long enough to do this (and we have normal sized hands), so we have to use the end of a smaller bottle or tube to press.  It's really a pain, and becomes extra important at the end of the bottle.2. Because you have to collapse the bottle like this, it becomes very, very difficult to measure how much your newborn has drunk.  That's a major problem initially when the difference between 1 and 1-1/2 ounces is important.3. This is the biggest: we've had the system fail once, catastrophically breaking the seal where the nipple screws on, and spilling milk all over.

Nielsen', 'helpful': [0, 0], 'reviewText': 'This particular starter set of Playtex Drop-Ins is a great place to start if you\'re looking for an economical way to sample a wide variety of nipple types and the Drop-Ins system as a whole. We did not need to purchase additional Drop-In bottles because of the quick and easy clean-up, although we did purchase extra nipples of the type our daughter preferred. We have used both the Playtex VentAire and Playtex Drop-In bottles for the past year as we switched between breastfeeding and bottle feeding with my daughter, who has just reached her first birthday. Of the two, Playtex VentAire has been my favorite bottle for transitioning between breastfeeding and bottle feeding, although neither has caused the dreaded "nipple confusion." In both cases, we use the slow flow variety of nipple for each bottle type. This is how the two compare:1. The Drop-Ins win hands-down for convenient clean-up and are thus our favorite to travel with. Throw out the old liner, pop in a new one, fill it up, and you\'re ready to go - easy to do even in the backseat of a car with a crying baby. No bottle brush or hot, soapy water needed.2. The VentAire slow flow nipples are much slower than the Drop-In slow flow nipples, which we have found is preferable for a baby that is accustomed to breastfeeding (more control over the milk flow, and thus less gagging and spitting up).3. Once a baby learns how to hold the bottle themselves, we have discovered that the VentAire bottle with a slow flow nipple can be flung wildly around and does not leak. However, the Drop-Ins bottle with a slow flow nipple leaks everywhere when it is turned upside-down (and baby WILL turn it upside-down). This is less of an issue if there will be parental supervision.4. Our daughter can feed herself from both the VentAire and Drop-In bottles, but it is a bit easier for her to handle the VentAire. She can feed herself one-handed while sleep-eating with the VentAire by grasping the recessed bottle bottom and holding it straight up in the air. The Drop-In bottle requires her to use two hands due to the fact it is wider, and if she falls asleep, the bottle is dropped and leaks wherever it lands.Both the Playtex Drop-In and Playtex VentAire bottles are nice sets, and we have appreciated having both types to choose from to enjoy the perks of both. For convenience and fast clean-up, the Playtex Drop-In system wins. For fewer leaks and more baby autonomy, the Playtex VentAire bottles get our vote.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Convenient clean-up, but Playtex VentAire nipples work better for breastfed babies', 'unixReviewTime': 1331424000, 'reviewTime': '03 11, 2012'}

Why? To avoid buying more liners and since my girls are now 13 months old, we bought some other bottles that don't use a liner. After having used ONLY Playtex Drop Ins for the 1st year and then using other types of bottles for around a month I am realizing how much not only myself but my girls LOVED the Playtex Drop Ins.The Playtex Nipples are definately what my girls prefer and are much easier for them. They normally finish their night time bottles but have not been finishing them since switching to different bottles. Also the new bottles have tons of air bubbles where the Playtex did NOT.The nipple size is also good for Preemie babies. When my girls were born they were too small to suckle on the breast and most bottles were too big for their tiny mouths. I do remember when my girls were under a month old we had some Advent bottles w/ silicone nipples someone had given us and I tried giving them to my girls once(the more bottles the merrier) but my girls HATED the nipples and they just seemed to big for their small mouths. I had to empty the Advent and pour them into the Playtex.And when I first wrote my 2 star review of these bottles because I hated the repeated cost of buying liners, that was also before I realized just how FANTASTICALLY WONDERFUL it is to be able to throw away the liner. Since we've bought these new bottles it seems all I ever do is wash bottles...and there have been MANY times when I forget I leave a bottle that had milk in the diaper bag or some other place and GROSS, what a stinky mess. Then I actually have to soak the bottles in bleach water to make sure they are clean. With the Playtex you simply throw away the stinky liner.So I am sorry Playtex Drop Ins that I ever doubted you & gave you a 2 star review. I guess this past month of Never-Ending Bottle washing & bleaching bottles has been my lesson learned. NEVER AGAIN will I use any other bottle besides Playtex Drop Ins. Except for water or juice, cheap bottles are fine for that.So save yourself time & money and just buy the Playtex Drop Ins ESPECIALLY if you have twins. It might cost more in liners but you'll be Thankful in the long run. My girls like the Playtex Latex nipples the best.You can buy store brand liners, we've used Walmart store brand and they work fine but Playtex are definately the best liner. Keep an eye out because the Playtex liners DO go on sale and then you can stock up. Make sure you have plenty on hand so you don't get stuck in the middle of the night w/out any liners. I also liked the bags but we only used them at first when I was pumping breast milk for my girls.

I purchased these bottles before my son, who is now 10 weeks old, was born. I planned to breastfeed exclusively. I planned to pump into these bottles. I even took a reviewers advice and got extra large bottles and short liners (which I wouldn\'t advise to anyone). I liked the idea of not needing to wash a million bottles. I didn\'t have a dishwasher at the time. (We now do... and maybe I would have stuck with these had that not been the case). I also have a psychotic cat that continually custom selected baby items from the dish drying rack. Drove me nuts.Nothing went to plan. I ended up supplementing my breast milk with formula after one month. My son eats a ton and these bottles don\'t really do well with formula.POWDERED FORMULAPowdered formula (which I can\'t stand) doesn\'t mix well in this bottle. Also, despite the wonderful design for keeping air out... you have to shake powdered formula. Thus, there\'s air in there and your baby will be gassy.LIQUID (RTF) FORMULAFormula is expensive. Pushing the air out of the bag is a GREAT concept. But when the bag exploded on me twice... I was upset. And reading reviews, I have to say I thought people were just pushing to quickly and clearly that would never happen to me. But it did. Twice. And with a screaming baby... it\'s really better to have bottles that are ready to go. (Even if prepared, you need to push air out of the bottle... and that takes time).BREASTMILKI don\'t pump enough to fill these bottles. Pumping takes a lot of time. So.. After I pump my four ounces, I don\'t want it to explode. And I don\'t want it to go bad from having so much exposure to air... And if I\'m pumping, I\'m not feeding my child right away. He eats all the time. Thus, I stopped "expressing" because it seemed to be a waste of time. Why pump into a bottle just to feed it to him right away? (I\'m empty after I finish pumping). Now... in the first few weeks, my son killed my nipples. So, pumping into the bottle came in handy. The pump was much kinder. I didn\'t care if he destroyed silicone. (He didn\'t... but I\'m just sayin\'!).I had no problem with the lids on these bottles. I actually prefer these caps to the "newer" ones I found at Babies R Us (for a much higher price). The plastic is sturdy. I liked the silicone nipples because I could boil them (and now I can put them in the dishwasher). This brand is kind of wonderful because they make a variety of bottles and the nipples can be used with different bottles.I didn\'t hate the bottle enough to say you shouldn\'t try it. But I didn\'t like it enough to continue using it. You do not need "extra" exterior bottles. The set comes with enough. The comparison would be like buying a bunch of vaccuums for your vaccuum bags.

My 5 week old has been using them since he was 1 week old and he has much less gas and spitting up when we use them as opposed to some other brands that we have tried.  I know these bottles have been around for a long time and now I understand why..they work.  I have found most of the new modern bottles to be all gimic and no substance.  The down side to these bottles is that you have to continually buy the bags which can get pricy.  It is also a little harder to travel with them because you have to bring the bottle, the bag, the water, and the formula all separate.  Futhermore, they don't come with caps for the nipples so you have to put your finger on the nipple to shake the formula and bag the nipple to travel with it.  I would tell anyone if they have been using Dr. Brown's, Avent, or any of the other super fancy feeding systems and their kids are still having problems with gas and spitting up, they should try these.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Tried and True..They Work', 'unixReviewTime': 1327363200, 'reviewTime': '01 24, 2012'}

These bottles have been around awhile for a reason.  I have 3 children and all three of them have preferred these bottles over all the others.  For the sake of trying something different this time around I went searching for a regular bottle this time.  Let me tell you, I wasted time and money and should have stuck with what I know works.  I tried (Avent, Dr. Brown's, Ventaire, Gerber Comfort Hold, Gerber Nuk wide bottles).  Here's what I found:  My little one would fuss with the Dr. Brown's and Avent and had difficulty latching on to both of them, she would choke and cough from the Gerber Comfort Hold bottles because the flow was too fast even on the slow flow nipples, she couldn't get anything out of the Nuk bottles and the Ventaire nipples where too hard she couldn't form a good seal on the nipple.  My opinion with the Dr. Brown's bottles are that they are not doing anything magical that the disposable bottles won't do because the nursers don't create a vacuum allowing air into the bottle while the baby is eating, so I think the extra cleaning with the Dr. Brown's, is a waste of time.  I also don't feel like the vent that sits on the top of the tube in the Dr. Brown's bottles can get totally clean even with their little brush. Which means sterilizing it everytime.  The positives about the nursers:  The flow rate on the nursers are just right.  My baby sounds like she is nursing when drinking from them and actually fusses when I take it away from her to burp her just like she does when I take her off the breast.  The silicone nipple is very soft and she seems to really like it.  No problems switching from breast to bottle.  I think it is a close second to the real thing--the breast.  The drop in liners for these bottles are very convenient and while it is an extra step when making the bottle it is very quick and easy.  The amount of time saved in washing regular bottles and in heating them up more than make up for the time it takes to drop a liner in.  These bottles heat up much faster than a regular bottle does which is appreciated by Dad and Grandma when they are feeding a hungry baby.  My recommendation is to not spend the money on all those other fancy, expensive bottles and stick with the tried and true.  Spend more time with baby and less washing bottles!", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Preferred by babies!!', 'unixReviewTime': 1177027200, 'reviewTime': '04 20, 2007'}

You have to buy the Playtex pump adapter kit to be able to do that but I think its still much cheaper than using milk storage bags.  Clean up couldn't be easier either, just throw it away.  That feature is great when traveling as well. You don't have to worry about your bottles not being clean because you use a fresh liner and the milk stays there until baby gets it, not getting transferred around from bottle to bag to bottle again.  I also liked that the liner was able to collapse on itself and didn't for a vacuum for baby to fight against like some bottles do.  I did have a few issues with the bottles leaking if they weren't screwed on just right but I think that happens if any bottle isn't screwed on right.

I saved money by buying them at thrift stores - about half of them I bought still in the boxes and the other half barely used. I ended up switching out the older nipple design (square top) with the newer nipples because I liked the design better. It seemed to me that the newer design is more correct for suckling. I also bought a lot of new boxes of liners at the thrift store too! My daughter suffered from mild gas, but nothing major. I liked these bottles because of the liner idea and my best friend had used them.I wish the nipples would have come in more than two stages though because when my daughter hit about 4 months, the slow flow were too slow and the fast flow were too fast. I ended up putting straight pins in the slow flow and boiling them with the pins in to open the holes a little more. It worked fine! The only time the bottle ever leaked was when I used the drop-in liners and that's because it wasn't seated right on the rim of the bottle. Many reviewers complained that the drop-ins don't hold a full 8 ozs. and they are correct. To solve this problem, I simply stuck with the standard liners and I don't buy the Playtex brand. I buy the Parent's Choice (PC) brand at Walmart. Another thing to be careful of is the measurements aren't always correct. I bought the Target brand 4 oz. liners and realized (after several bottles) that the 4 oz. mark on the liner was only 3 ozs. The PC liners are correct!All-in-all, I like these bottles but am getting tired of the liners. I am currently reading reviews of other bottles and considering switching with our next child.
