I had played every single Sonic game for the Genesis. I had watched Sonic cartoon episodes and the Sonic movie countless times. I had read as many Sonic comics as I could handle. I crammed my head with as much stuff about Sonic as I could. I even created my own Sonic website. But, after a while the same old levels on the original Sonic games got old. I needed something new. I needed something fresh. Then, I heard about Sonic Adventure. Just because of me being a Sonic fanatic, Sonic Adventure and the Dreamcast were at the top of my Christmas list. Finally, I received it along with a Dreamcast and popped it in. As soon as the opening sequence began, I was stunned. I was amazed at the great graphics and use of real music with vocals and all. Plus, Sonic looked cooler than ever. Then, the game got even better because of the ability to be 6 different classic Sonic characters and some new ones. The game is perfect because each character has a different story line that blends in with another character's story. Plus, the classic Sonic and Tails brothership and Sonic and Knuckles competivness still remain. If you are a true Sonic fan like me, though, you might be a little disappointed. The game missed many classic Sonic elements and Sonic's orgin is totally changed. The Freedom Fighters are gone, Sonic lives on Earth instead of Mobius, and Tails' age has gone up by 6 years while Sonic's only has risen by 1. Plus, Sonic Adventure is more childish than previous Sonic games because of the Chao pets. The game should be more focused one defeating Robotnik instead of raising a little pet.Still, the game has the classic Sonic feel to it because the chaos emeralds are still intact, and when you collect them you can become an even better Super Sonic than the one in the previous years. Other great additions include mini-games and 3-D cinema scenes. One of the best parts of the game is the re-make of the original Ice Cap stage from Sonic 3 and the ability to ride a snowboard that you can actually control, unlike in the original.

That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two.  Also, the graphics and sound are good.  My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English.  (That is if you have the language set on English.)

I find it more enjoyable than Sonic Adventure 2 and I also think it's just as great as 3&K.; I'll explain why this one is my favorite Sonic game of all time. This recent I got the original Dreamcast version along with the console itself and I also have the the DX port for the GameCube and Xbox Live Arcade.GAME-PLAY: The game is split with six characters with their own game-play mechanics. The characters are Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big, and Gamma. Sonic's game-play mechanic is just like the original 3 games, get to the end of level. Tails' game-play mechanic is the same as Sonic's but however when playing as Tails, you race against Sonic and to get to the end before he does. Knuckles' game-play mechanic is finding 3 Master Emerald shards. Amy's game-play mechanic is same as Sonic's too, but while playing through a stage with Amy, you run away from a robot name Zero who is one of Eggman's robots. Big's game-play mechanic is fishing for a frog name Froggy. Gamma's game-play mechanic is getting to the end of level within the time limit. Each character has their own abilities with some upgrades like Sonic using the Homing Attack and Light Dash, Tails flying with two tails and using his Tail Spin, Knuckles punching enemies and digging with his Shovel Claw, Amy uses her Piko Piko Hammer, Big uses his lure to fish, and Gamma shoots his laser at enemies. In my opinion I liked all six game-play mechanics especially Big's game-play too because to me it make the game more enjoyable with some new ideas added to the series. There are 11 levels but not everyone goes through all of them. Sonic goes through all of the levels except for one, Tails, Knuckles, and Gamma go through 5 levels, Big goes through 4 levels, and Amy goes 3 levels. The levels are Emerald Coast, Windy Valley, Casinopolis, Ice Cap, Twinkle Park, Speed Highway, Red Mountain, Hot Shelter, Sky Deck, Lost World, and Final Egg. My favorite levels are Emerald Coast, Windy Valley, Ice Cap, Speed Highway, Red Mountain, Lost World, and Final Egg. The bosses while they are easy, are pretty fun to fight against. Bosses like Perfect Chaos, Egg Viper, etc are enjoyable boss battles.STORY: The story is really great. A young echidna name Tikal use to guard the Master Emerald, took care of the Chao, and was friends with Chaos. But her people have causes trouble there and were vanished by Chaos. Tikal tries to stop Chaos by sealing him in the Master Emerald, but then Dr. Eggman free Chaos and he aided him. Tikal was now a light ball and then asked Sonic and his friends to save the world before Chaos destroys everything.MUSIC: This has be my favorite soundtrack all time from a Sonic game. The music fits the stage really well and the characters themes are fun to listen to. In fact some music from this game were reused from the Genesis version of 3D Blast.GRAPHICS: The graphics look really fantastic for a Dreamcast/Gamecube game! Characters models look good for both the original Dreamcast version and the DX port, but I think the Dreamcast has better character models and also better lighting. While I do like the DX port, the problem with it is that the models in the DX port while good, are too shiny.VOICE ACTING: The voice acting is a different story, but I will say this, I think the Japanese voice acting was great. The English voice acting however hasn't age well one bit and it's really showing because it's not that good.CONCLUSION: Overall, this is the best Sonic game I ever played! The game-play is fun with it's replay value, awesome music, good graphics, and a really great story! It's better than Adventure 2! Adventure 2 had it shares of flaws but that game is still good.

The day the Sega Dreamcast was launched with a few dozen titles available at launch. One of them was Sonic Adventure. I have played every Genesis Sonic game for hours and hours and have been a huge fan of Sonic ever since. I was very excited when I got this game with my Dreamcast.I started to play with Sonic. The game was awesome. Then I realized you could play with five other characters. Tails, Knuckles, Big, the robot, and Amy. Each character has 3 or so levels for each of them and are also very different for each character. Each character is very fun to play as especially Sonic, Knuckles and Tails. Surprisingly Big and the robot are very fun to play with. But Sega should never have created such a dumb character as Amy. She is very annoying, hard to play with and is very hard to control as well.This game has a few flaws though, like falling through the floor for no reason at all. Also, the camera angles are not the way you want them to be very often and this game is too easy on all levels for almost all of the characters. Sonic Adventure is also kind of short.Even with these few flaws, Sonic Adventure is a great game, that will keep you playing for hours on end having a ton of fun.

There is plenty to do and a storyline of 6 different characters to view different aspects of the plot. Sonic has standard, fast-paced levels. Tails has to race against Sonic in his stages. Knuckles has to look for shards of his beloved Master Emerald. Amy has to evade an annoying robot named Zero. Big has to fish for Froggy (Worst part). E-102 Gamma has to destroy his "brothers" in a time limit. The characters also have cool special stages like "Twinkle Circuit". And the Chao Garden, which you and raise Chao and make use of the Dreamcast VMU.The main plot is simple, keep Dr. Eggman/Robotnik from getting all the Chaos Emeralds before he uses them on the evil ancient monster, Chaos, to dominate the world.

I guess it is because I love to explore and make my way through those cool-looking worlds. And I have to tell you, Sonic Adventure's worlds look great. This was the very first 128 bit game I had played and boy, was I excited. The game really disappointed and annoyed me however.After playing through the game a bit, you will start to realize that after the fun action stages, you will begin a squence of boring and annoying cut-scenes (that you can't skip) that will drive you mad. Most of them involve sonic and Robotnik threatening each other, or just characters talking. Also, the characters will pause between almost every sentence. It takes forever for them to finish what they are saying, and you won't really care most of the time. Boring. If you make it through the cut-scenes, then you wander through the adventure stages, looking for the next action stage. Mainly by going to a red hint sphere that will say something like &quot;Have you searched the entire adventure stage yet?&quot;When you find another action stage, things will get a bit better, but only for a while. Some of the cool things you can do are snowboard, speed through a futuristic highway. Cool. But, then it is back to boredom and the annoying voices (especially tails.)

There is the adventure mode that is quite subpar, minigames that are mediocre, and finally the stages that are very fun to play. Once you clear a stage or minigame on the adventure mode, it unlocks and you may just play it by itself from the main menu when the game boots up. You may play as 6 different characters, all with their own unique stories, stages, and minigames. I thought this was a brilliant implementation of the game. Although, admittedly the Sonic and Tails stages are way more fun the the stages for Big the Cat, Knuckles, or the robot. The Amy stages are somewhere in the middle.The controls are somewhat frustrating at times, particularly in the adventure mode. The NPC humans in the adventure mode look downright like stick figures graphically, and stand there like manequins unless you knock into them. Then they flinch for a moment and go right back to their original position.The adventure mode plays like an exploration game. You must figure out what to do to get to the next cutscene, minigame, or stage. You must find the object or area that will take you to it. This is a rather mundane and boring, sometimes frustrating, part of the game.Sometimes the camera angles in this game make it so you can not see your character or get any sense of direction. Again, this is most often in the adventure mode.The cutscenes in the adventure mode are well presented and timed. The fade from the adventure mode to the cutscenes is well paced. The graphics look great, and soundtrack well performed.I highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the sonic characters, as you can play and develop so many of them. If you like action or 3D platformer type games, you will probably enjoy this game as well.This game is definitely worth a play though to see if you like it.

{'reviewerID': 'A2W6SI073FIRMA', 'asin': 'B00000K3X9', 'reviewerName': 'KlownArt', 'helpful': [1, 4], 'reviewText': "Sonic AdventureWhen the Dreamcast first came out, this was one of the games you had to have. Sonic, being the cornerstone of Sega, was expected to be Sega'sSuper Mario 64. Although it failed to meet that expectation, they did create a fairly fun game. I still think if you own a Dreamcast that this needs to be in your collection. If you don't own a Dreamcast, there is no reason to find one just for this game.Graphics- 7/10At the time these were really good graphics. They couldn't stand up toSoul Calibur, but it was still solid. Many problems lie within the graphics though. The level design is poor. The Adventure Zones are small and yet have a loading screen every time you walk through a door. Action Zones are sometimes better, like in Twinkle Park, but not usually. The camera has all kinds of problems. You will become annoyed very quickly if you find yourself in a small room and the camera is caught. The graphics are smooth and have some good details, but overall the level design is just ugly.Story- 8.5/10This is probably the best aspect of the game. In this game you don't just play as Sonic, you can play as five other characters: Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E-102, and Big. You can't just pick whoever you want, you have to start as Sonic and earn other characters. One you earn another character, you can go play through their stories. You earn other characters by meeting them in the game. So, the stories sort of intertwine. You never wonder what other characters were doing because you can play as them all and figure out. Other than that, the story is you basic Sonic story. Dr. Robotnik is causes havoc and you have to stop him. It's just interesting because it shows how the story affects all the characters in the game.Sound- 6/10Your basic Sonic sounds. You have some decent music here and there, and that stupid jump noise. A lot of music is reused over and over again. The sound in this game is just above average and has nothing special about it.Gameplay- 6.5/10Although they added in the ability to play as different characters, this is still a very bad gameplay wise game. As Sonic, you go through the longest portions of the game. Sonic's story is probably one of the most interesting and well worth your time. Tails consists of you racing Sonic to try to prove that you are just as good as him. This is fairly fun, but you are practically just replaying a portion of Sonic's game. As Amy you will be protecting a bird. You have a hammer as a weapon, which is at least a little interesting. As Big you have to fish to find your friend, Froggy. This is a change in pace, but it is poorly done and very annoying trying to catch that stupid frog. Knuckles can glide and climb on things. As Knuckles you are looking for pieces of crystals. This is fun, but far too easy. As E-102 you are working for Robotnik for most of the game, but you also get to play the aftermath. He has probably the easiest game in the entire game as he uses a gun.Difficulty- 2/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)The game is either extremely easy, or it is annoying like Big's is. The game can be flown through. The only thing that keeps the length up is the multiple characters. Even with all the characters, this game can easily be beat within 2 days. I know the game is based for a younger audience, but it could offer a little challenge.

Two weeks before I picked up Sonic Adventure I saw the demo in a video game store and was " BLOWN AWAY " by what I saw. My all time favorite hedge-hog moving so fast that my eyes could hardly keep up with him, and the graphics of 128 bit bliss was awesome indeed! After I brought it home a few weeks later, I was again blown away by the free roaming 3d game-play of this awesome game. Sonic Adventure was ( and is ) so big and so grand, that I find it hard to write just a paragraph on the game, but here it goes. The game takes place on Angel Island, ( a floating island )  and it is somehow connected to a city. You have six players in this awesome game. There\'s: Sonic the Hedgehog, Miles "Tails" Prower, Amy Rose, ( Sonic\'s love interest ) Knuckles the Echidna, Big the Cat, and E-102 Gamma. ( one of Eggman\'s robots ) You must stop Eggman from feeding the seven Chaos Emeralds to the evil monster Chaos, also known as " The God of Destruction. " The game moves so fast at times it makes one dizzy. ( and try not to barf! ) Besides the " Adventure Mode ", you have the " Action Stages ", and the cute lil\' Chao\'s to take care of in the Chao gardens. It\'s kind of a virtual pet that you can interact with, and you can even download mini games onto the VMU memory card, then take the VMU out of the controller and play the game separately on it. ( cool ) You have many mini games, action stages, power-ups, worlds, and objectives to play in this wonder of a game. It\'s part Action, RPG, fishing, exploratory, puzzle, racing, shoot-em-up, and fighting game all rolled into one big adventure. ( whew ) If there ever was a game that gave the player \'his or her\' money\'s worth, this game does it well! If there was any complaint I might have, it\'s that I hate the fishing levels with Big the Cat. ( it\'s hard as hell to me ) Sonic Adventure for the Sega Dreamcast is one of the best games ever made for this great system. Even NiGHTS into Dreams makes a cameo appearance in the game. ( it\'s very cool ) So if you\'re into Sonic, and have a Dreamcast, this game must be in your collection for it to be complete. Yuji Naka and the Sonic team did it again in spades!!! " Happy Gaming!

Amy Rose returns from her Sonic Cd debut with abilities that require her hammer. Big the cat has nothing interesting except for fishing.Then there\'s Gamma Dr Robotniks newest robot with abilities. When u beat all the character stories unlock the Super Sonic story.Story:  On Angel Island, an island floating above Earth. The Knuckles Tribe\'s ruler Pachacamac plans for world domination. His daughter Tikal enters a shrine, discovering the Chaos Emeralds and the Master Emerald, a group of mysterious emeralds with unlimited power. She befriends a peaceful entity known as Chaos, the guardian of the emeralds, as well as the Chao. Despite warnings from Tikal, Pachacamac and the tribe run into the shrine. However, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, destroying the island and killing everyone there. Following Chaos\' attack, Tikal seals the entity and herself inside the Master Emerald.Three thousand years later, Knuckles the Echidna guards the Master Emerald on the floating Angel Island when the evil scientist Doctor Eggman sets free Chaos. The Master Emerald is shattered and Angel Island plunges into the sea, causing the Master Emerald\'s shards and the seven Chaos Emeralds to be scattered. Resolving to search for the shards of the Master Emerald, Knuckles sets off. In Station Square, Sonic the Hedgehog sets off and defeats Chaos after witnessing an attack by the police. Miles "Tails" Prower tests his Chaos Emerald-powered airplane, only to crash on the beach of Emerald Coast. After Sonic rescues Tails, they go to his workshop in the Mystic Ruins, where they are confronted by Eggman. The mad scientist uses Tails\' emerald to transform Chaos and he reveals his ultimate plan: with the power harnessed from the Emeralds, Chaos will eventually become invincible and destroy Station Square and Eggman will build Robotnikland over the city\'s ruins. Sonic and Tails set off searching for emeralds to prevent Eggman from getting them first, but eventually lose the ones they find to Dr. Eggman and Chaos. Dr. Eggman escapes in his airship, the Egg Carrier, which shoots down Sonic and Tails\'s pursuing plane.After Eggman activates E-102 Gamma and fights E-101 Beta during his training, Eggman orders the rest of the E-Series robots to search for Froggy, a frog who has eaten Chaos\'s tail as well as a Chaos Emerald. Gamma finds Froggy but is chased back to the ship by Froggy\'s owner Big the Cat. After his crash, Tails finds another emerald and uses it to prepare the Tornado II plane to find Sonic while Sonic lands in Station Square once again. While lamenting her time with Sonic, Amy Rose discovers a Flicky bird and names him Birdie. However, Eggman, having discovered Birdie\'s location, dispatches his robot Zero to chase the Flicky down. After Sonic turns down an offer to protect Birdie, Zero captures Amy and Birdies and detains them both on Eggman\'s ship, the Egg Carrier. Sonic and Tails board the Tornado II and infiltrates the Egg Carrier. Knuckles also boards the aircraft after collecting pieces of the Master Emerald and seeing an image of the Egg Carrier in the emerald.On board the Egg Carrier, Eggman removes the E-Series robots and stations Gamma in Amy\'s cell. However, Gamma witnesses Beta being rebuilt, Amy convinces him that Gamma should not work for Eggman, as he is an enemy. In a confusion of newly discovered emotions, Gamma releases Amy and Birdie. While being chased by Zero, Amy goes to the ship\'s deck. Meanwhile, Sonic and Tails confront Eggman, but Gamma is dispatched to attack Sonic. Despite attacking Sonic with lasers, Sonic defeats Gamma, but Amy interferes and has Sonic spare Gamma. Gamma, understanding that Eggman is an enemy, decides to follow the others. The ship loses altitude and Tails, Amy, and Gamma flee, while Sonic restores the ship to its original form. Sonic is confronted by Chaos, who now has six Chaos Emeralds, and defeats it once more before pursuing Eggman. Meanwhile, Knuckles steals back the six Chaos Emeralds and Big uses the Tornado II; they both flee from the ship as it crashes.Gamma decides to track down his brother robots. After freeing the animals inside the robots, he goes to the Egg Carrier and confronts Beta, in his rebuilt form. Beta uses lasers and missiles to attack Gamma, only to be defeated once more by Gamma. However, the fight also causes Gamma to be destroyed and Birdie\'s parents are released. Returning to the Egg Carrier, Amy reunites Birdie with its family, but she is confronted by Zero after he knocks down the Flicky. After avoiding contact with Zero\'s lasers, Amy defeats the robot by using her Piko Piko Hammer and the electrical fences. She sees Birdie and his family off, much to her happiness, and vows to try her best. Sonic and Tails, meanwhile, defeat Eggman in the Egg Viper and Egg Walker, respectively.A day later, Knuckles restores the shards of the Master Emerald, but Angel Island collapses into the sea once again when Chaos attacks him and Dr. Eggman. Chaos absorbs the 6 Chaos Emeralds and locates the seventh aboard the Tornado II, which crashed after Big used it to escape the Egg Carrier. With all the Chaos Emeralds, Chaos transforms into Perfect Chaos, depleting the Chaos Emeralds of their negative energy, and flooding and destroying Station Square. Tikal appears, having taken each main character into the past numerous times beforehand, demanding that Chaos must be sealed back in the Master Emerald. Sonic objects, saying that Chaos\'s heart would still be filled with anger and sadness if he were to be sealed inside the Master Emerald. Sonic\'s friends cheer him on, and Sonic uses the Chaos Emeralds\' still-present positive energy to become Super Sonic and face off against Perfect Chaos. Following Chaos\' defeat, Sonic discovers that the Chao he once was guardian of now live in Station Square, so he leaves them on Earth to live there. United with Tikal, Chaos peacefully departs to the past. The game ends with Sonic chasing after the fleeing Dr. Eggman.Music: Sonic Adventure shows new music from crush 40 as well as old music from another Sonic game.In this game we get powerups and upgrades for Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Gamma,& Big the cat.When u played all the story\'s u unlock final story where chaos has all 7 emeralds and u must defeat him.Controls: This games controls are easy to get use to once u start playing it.Abilities: Sonic has his spindash on a seperate button as well as introducing the light speed dash.

That rating is now at 5 stars.Before I start, I want to get a few things straight. Unfortunatly, Sega made the Dreamcast its last system. The Sega Saturn turned most people away from the Dreamcast, mainly because the Saturn (...). Production of Dreamcasts has stopped. This is why I own two. Sega moved from a First-Party developer to a Third-Party. They have started producing games for other systems, starting with Sonic Adventure 2 on the GameCube and Sonic Advance for the Game Boy Advance. Why they\'re hugging onto Nintendo, I don\'t know, but I thank them for not going to Sony or Microsoft. With that said, let\'s start talking about the game.First off, if Sonic Adventure is too fast or hard for you, just go sell your Dreamcast; you can\'t handle it. The game wasn\'t made to be fast or hard. It was made as an introduction to the Dreamcast\'s awesome power, and to carry the Sonic legend on. In my opinion, Sonic is easy. There is no point in buying a guide. It is just the right speed and I wish it was faster. But this is just my opinion.In a graphical standpoint, Sonic Adventure is amazing. The crisp visuals and not-so-often slowdown turned most people on. Rock on, Sega. 5 out of 5 for graphics.The sound. Whoo boy, there\'s the problem. It has an awesome soundtrack. But the voice acting? Did they hire a 5-year-old for Tails? Big sounds like a (...). Good voice choices elesewhere, but the acting (...). 3 out of 5, Sega. Redeem yourselves.Replay value? It skyrockets. There are five characters to play as, all with their own stories and objectives. The game doesn\'t end after each character has been completed. Instead, one more character is introduced, one that has been in every Sonic game to date. Can you guess his name? The first word rhymes with "cooper." 5 out of 5 for replay.The overall score? If you don\'t know that, you must be flipping. How many stars did I give it, genius? Read the review, for the love of Pete.Those who just pass up the Dreamcast because of Sega\'s past image are missing out on a treat. Happy Halloween, gamers.

(Creator of Dynamite Alex for Andro...', 'helpful': [0, 0], 'reviewText': "How complicated must it be for Sega to make a game on a console that's still in development at the same time? And yet, the final game is a smash hit that happens to be pretty top-notch. They've pulled through then, I guess.The game lets you choose to play as 6 different characters (However, you unlock them by playing as Sonic first). We have Sonic (of course), Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E103 Omega, and....Big the Cat...Each of the characters have their own gameplay mechanics, as well as goals and certain levels. Below is the fun factor for each character.Sonic - The levels are actually pretty straightforward. You simply go from start to finish. And boy was it fun.. It's actually pretty close to the Genesis Sonic games, but in 3D. Collect rings, bash robots, you know..The good stuff. Plus, there are some new level-specific gameplay mechanics included, like Twinkle Park's bumper car riding, and Sky Chase's airplane combat! You may as well buy this game just for Sonic alone. After all, as the title character, he has the most levels to go through.Tails - More or less like Sonic's gameplay except he has to race Sonic (later, Eggman, in Speed Highway) in each level. It's not as bad as it may sound, because it only just keeps the pace going, which is great, and don't you think it's kind of exciting to find shortcuts when flying?Knuckles - Rather than going from start to finish, Knuckles has to find 3 Emeralds in each level. So how do you do so? You glide around the place and see if an Emerald is picked up on a radar (REALLY helpful), and they could be hidden in enemies or other places. The only minor (And only MINOR) downside with Knuckles is that there are only about 1 (or 2?) Emeralds throughout the game that could only be found by digging into the ground. I was expecting Knuckles's digging upgrade to be used a bit more specifically for finding Emeralds.Amy - She isn't as fast as the above 3 characters, but she still isn't a bad pick. Although having the same robot chase her throughout levels is a little cringe-inducing, Amy plays pretty well, as she can attack with her massive hammer.E103 Omega - Alright. Who expected a robot to be playable in a Sonic game? I certainly haven't, but I'm glad I am. Omega's gameplay involves massive deals of weaponry, as well as being able to hover later on, and do certain tasks in the levels. In Final Egg, for example, you must destroy Sonic dolls. In Emerald Coast, you catch Froggy. In other levels, you must go destoy other Omega robots! I absolutely love playing as this thing, as much as I love playing as the first 3 characters.Big - Big is a pretty lame downside to this game. He's slow, and you have to go fishing for things. It's as fun as described, and I certainly don't want to go back to playing as him. Sadly, you have to beat the game as all characters if you want to fight the actual last boss, Perfect Chaos, so........That pretty much covers up the characters. As for everything else, the level design is magnificent and lovingly crafted. Plus, the graphics are awesome for the time, and the soundtrack rocks!However, Sonic Adventure is not without flaws. The cutscenes aren't amazing, and while the story is nicely done, some bits of dialogue are a bother (THAT'S A CHAOS EMERALD! - Says Knuckles as 2 Chaos Emeralds have been spotted). Oh, yeah, and there's Big the Cat.

After all, the Sonic the Hedgehog series is one of the most popular in videogame history. Was it worth the wait? Was it worth the hype? Is it worth picking up even now?The transition from 2D to 3D has been much discussed in the past, and you can see why. What works great in 2D doesn't always translate so well into the 3D world. And when a series makes this sometimes awkward transition there are usually a few hiccups.Sonic Adventure attempts to use level design that gives you the speed of the original games, while also featuring puzzle solving and rpg/adventure elements (talk to people, play mini-games, open doors, ect.). By featuring several different characters for you to play as, the game allows you to play a balanced game (sonic), blast through stages with nothing slowing you down (tails), run away like a chicken (amy), shoot everythign in sight (the robot), go on a treasure hunt (knuckles), or spend all your time fishing(?) (big the cat). Each of these elements is entertaining in its own right, but where the game really shines is the action scenes as sonic and tails. The adventure portion of this game suffers from the same flaw as many rpgs (namely, you can't find the stupid key to open the door). So the first time through you may hit a few snags. And the some of the more adventure/platformer elements can get VERY frustrating (I hate the platforming section of the snow level and the skydeck level in particular). And of course, the collision detection, polygon clipping, and camera problems are pretty darn buggy.Still, you've got to love this game.

The first thing Sonic does is fight a monster called "Chaos". After beating Chaos, the camera turns to Eggman, who ominously tells himself Sonic has no idea what he is up against... the perfect start to the game. Sonic then goes off to rescue Tails from a plane crash, starting the first level. Emerald Coast was a beautifully rendered beach with a beautiful theme and HUGE 3D ACTION! The camera shifts and Sonic is suddenly is being chased by a giant whale! After that he runs through a tight cave... and then finally rescues Tails! After a happy reunion, Eggman steals Tail\'s Chaos Emerald and feeds it to... Chaos the monster. Congratulations, you can now play as Tails! He can fly! His levels involve racing Sonic and Eggman (Just like in Sonic R!), and thats about it. The best thing about Tails was his inspirational motto, "I want to fly high! I shall belive in myself!". After Tails was Knuckles, who had a totally different story. One night he was rethinking his life and why exactly he was guarding the Master Emerald, when somebody steals the Master Emerald (way to go, Knucklehead)! His levels are composed of finding the Master Emerald pieces. Knuckles wasn\'t nearly as good as Tails. After Knuckles comes Amy Rose, Sonic\'s... girlfriend. Her levels focused on platforming while avoiding a robot that decided to chase her. Maybe a 6 year old girl would find Amy and her obnoxious theme song cool, but the teenage nerd reviewing this finds Amy very annoying. Big was next... and Sega really should avoided this idea while in development. Big is a BIG "cat", according to the Sonic Team. He really looked like a purple bunny-bear creature. His whole goal was to find his pet frog... Froggy (what a clever name!). It was torture watching him trudge to some water in the great zones Sonic and Tails enjoyed. Twinkle Park was only a lake for Big. For Sonic it was a bumper car ride followed by intense platforming, and the great voices Sonic, Tails, Amy, E-102 Gamma, and Eggman made Big even worse. In a dumb voice Big constantly shouts "FROGGY! WHERE ARE YA!?".Thankfully, E102 Gamma came after Big. Gamma is a robot built by Eggman. You start out following Eggman\'s orders: Shoot the Sonic Doll, shoot the real Sonic, lock Amy in jail. After that, Gamma accidently sees Eggman torturing his robot rival, Beta, and starts to wonder if he should follow Eggman\'s rules. Like every good robot character, Gamma decides to betray Eggman and find his true destiny...*SPOILER!*Which, sadly, is exploding while sad music plays.*SPOILER OVER*Update (10/19/12): Okay, I am almost through with this game and feel like throwing up. The end is VERY intense, with the Final Egg level almost being impossible due to collision issues and camera bugs, but I got through it.

I love sonic.  They're all great games, and I really wanted to see Sonic in 3D that actually looks real.  Okay, so now I'll get to the point.It's a great game!!!  The graphics are exelent, and the gameplay is awesome too.  All the action levels are great.  So maybe Dr. Robotnik has a big flying ship called the Egg Carrier.  So what's wrong with that?  I know, maybe it's sort of strange, but it's really fun.  It's a must have game, and with a price so low, there's absolutly no reason not to buy this game.  Give me some excuses.  It's a great game, and you must have it or else i'll hang you by your thumbs for a while.  It's a great game.  One other thing that's great about this game, is that it's not just focussing on killing all the enemys around you, you have to walk around and get the chaos emeralds from various places (mostly in action stages,) and if you don't, then Dr. Robotnik or &quot;Eggman&quot;'s Chaos will get them instead and Chaos will become super powerful and almost invincible.  Then Eggman will destroy everything and take over the world and blah blah blah.  Any way, It's a great game, So BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great Game all around!!!', 'unixReviewTime': 1010620800, 'reviewTime': '01 10, 2002'}

Sonic Adventure is fast paced, good time gaming. Controls are easy to use, graphics are pretty good, and there are many characters to choose from, but you have to find them. The voice overs are really bad because their mouth moves at a different time then when they actually speak. There are many levels to go through, and each level has three levels to beat it with, A, B, and C. Overall it's a good game, but once you beat it with everyone, you don't really want to go back. There's no replay value in this game, but it's good until you beat it. Hope this was useful for you.

This is an awesome game, one of the best adventure games I've ever played (I'm an adventure video game fan).  But the reason I gave it 4 stars is because it was confusing at some points in the game.  Most of the time after a cinematic scene ended they would just leave me there with no clue what to do or where to go, except sometimes right before the scene ended the character would say, &quot;I've gotta follow him!&quot; or, &quot;Let's go find out!&quot; or something like that.  That was the only flaw in this game, however.  If you like adventure games, or if you're just looking for a good time with a video game (and if you own a Dreamcast) buy this game.

The story line is cool and thought out. Only draw back is you have to is through the cut scenes...and they can be kind of long sometimes...The rest of the game-play and plot and story connecting is really great though. The game is going on 15 years old, and for that much time to pass and it still be just as fun (to me) as any game today, that says something.No the graphics aren't AMAZING, the voice acting is not AMAZING, the game-play is not the most intuitive, and the camera angles...let's face it are just plain horrible through most of the game. All that being said, it is still a piece of Dreamcast history and Sonic history as well.

I've also played this game, Sonic Adventure. This game was the best selling game on the Dreamcast. I definetely see why. Great camera angles, great platforming, great speed, great graphics, good voice acting, acceptional cut-scenes, it's perfect. If you want a great 3D Sonic game, get this one. It's also on Gamecube, Xbox Live Marketplace and Playstation Network Store. I don't care what you get it on, just get it.

Since then, no game has really impressed me for the N64. Sure Perfect Dark and Zelda: Majora's Mask were great, but nothing could touch Zelda 64. Then, last weekend I received Dreamcast as a Confirmation gift, along with a memory pack (required if you want to save your game, and I think u do) and Sonic Adventure. Now, folks, I was a HUGE fan of Sonic back in his glory days with the Genesis, which reached it's peak with Sonic 2. Needless to say, playing gave me a true sense of nostalgia.Well, within minutes I was hooked to Sonic Adventure. The graphics are absolutely amazing. The level design is the best that I have ever seen. I love how Sonic Team chose to incorporate some RPG elements by including an overworld and some powerup items. What takes this game from great to being a true phenomenon is the playability of 6 characters. I got the game on Thursday and beat the Sonic Quest saturday night... that's not all though! I still have 5 more characters, each with his or her own quests and storylines. Tails and Knuckles are among the playable characters.Take the numerous quests and throw in some mini-games and you have a game that will give you 20+ hours of gameplay.Don't get me wrong, SA has it's flaws. The most noticable is the sometimes awkward camera angles. However, the good outweighs the bad 10 to 1, and SA is a must-have for any Dreamcast owner.Overall, Sonic Adventure was a great game to introduce me to my Dreamcast.

Yeah, Super Mario 64 on N64 was a great game and all, but it didn't retain the same aspects as the previous 2D Mario games, and many gamers felt it was a much different experience than the other ones, Especially without Mario's brother, Luigi. However, in Sonic Adventure, you get that good ol' feeling, along with all of Sonic's best friends that you've known to love, not to mention a few new surprises here and there! One of the coolest features is the voice-acting! You can have it play in English OR Japanese. What other game does that?! It also supports 5 different languages in text (English, Japanese, German, French, and Spanish), or you can turn off the text. Each of the levels are beautifully rendered in wonderful colors, and Sonic's speed reminds you how large each stage really is. The Lost World action stage is one of the best stages out there in gaming. To go with it's great graphics, new ideas in where you perform multiple tasks, even get chased Indiana Jones-style by giant boulder (this one's on fire!), the music is triple-A (AAA) quality! Actually, most of Sonic Adventure's music is AAA. There are initially five characters to choose from the start of the game, and then six (Super Sonic), after you complete the original five starters' adventures. Super Sonic's adventure takes each of the components from the other five (Chaos Emeralds, Master Emerald, flashbacks, characters), and you are there to witness the final showdown with the game's ultra-menace, Chaos... only now, there's something gone terribly wrong! Chaos has used up the 7 emerald's powers to transform into Perfect Chaos! Robotnik (Eggman), Sonic, and his pals all team up to take him.
