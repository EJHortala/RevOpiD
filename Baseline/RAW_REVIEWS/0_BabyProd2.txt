Besides he was sweating the whole time he was feeding. I highly recommend the Bjorn. Well worth the money and although the A and B tabs don't look secure they are.

Alexander "thinkingmom"', 'helpful': [9, 9], 'reviewText': "I am the the mother of a 14 week old who has reflux and is uncomfortable sleeping in a crib or anywhere flat. She wants to be held *all* the time, and it was getting pretty exhausting in our arms (and my chronic tendonitis was flaring up) until we ordered the sling after reading about it in Dr. Sears's The Baby Book.  I had my doubts, but boy has it been a lifesaver!The sling has been invaluable for me, my husband, and our regular sitter. With it, we are able to walk, bounce, give the calming pinky finger treatment, and see what's going on with the baby. She started using the sling at 2 weeks, when she was about 7 pounds. It took a few times, but she is now completely comfortable in it and it is a favorite napping spot.As I am large-breasted, I did find it awkward to breastfeed in it, although I've been able to do it successfully a couple of times in public sitting down.  The fabric is soft and easily washable (important for those baby mishaps).  The padding helps me feel comfortable as a bit of protection in case of bumping.  The size is very adjustable for different height people, although you may need to pull through a lot of fabric to bring small babies in tightly, especially if you have a smaller chest size.The NoJo sling would benefit from having some loose fabric at the end to cover the baby's head in the sun and provide more coverage during breastfeeding. The stopper piece of plastic at the end of the fabric adds safety (it won't pull through), however it can whack the baby if you aren't careful when getting it on or off.  It could also use a zippered storage area, a feature of some other slings.  Also, the blue with plaid seems to be the only fabric sold these days, although I have seen other patterns and colors on eBay.  This is fine with jeans, but not great when you have to go to a wedding, as I did with the sling earlier this summer. I think it also makes people think that she's a boy, for some reason.  Maybe it's the blue and the fact that they can't see her cute dresses!The sling is also helpful in keeping interested strangers at a slight distance away from the baby -- they are less able to grab at her, which I think is good from a germ perspective, especially for newborns. When it is very hot or humid out, this sling can be a bit heavy for the baby (especially up against a hot mama!), but on cooler days the fabric adds just the right amount of warmth, like a light blanket.When I was pregnant, I assumed the Baby Bjorn would be all we would need. Instead it hangs on a hook most of the time unless we're going for a long walk or shopping -- activities where having two hands is important and you'll be doing them for a while. That thing is so hard to get on and off! Plus, you aren't supposed to use it until they are 8 lbs. The baby seems to really like the flexibility of positioning with the sling -- especially curling up happily in a womb-like ball -- and sometimes gets irritated by being all dangled out in the Bjorn.Carrying the baby in the sling makes you so much more mobile than using a stroller or lugging her around in her heavy carseat, so I use it whenever I anticipate being in public where they are stairs, space issues, or other impediments.  It's good for short shopping trips as well, especially if you're with a friend who can carry things or push a cart, both of which are harder to do with the sling on.She's also a million times more comfortable in the sling than in her car seat, where she often cries.  Our NoJo Babysling has been in constant use since it arrived, and ties the bouncy seat (where she mostly sleeps by day) as the best return on investment of any of the baby gizmos we bought.  Our sitter will often wear the baby for her entire nap. The sitter just sits (often in a rocking chair or porch swing to provide some more movement) and reads while the baby sleeps.One last thing that's great is that when the baby falls asleep, she can be laid down on the bed or bouncy chair and the sling just slips off the wearer without waking the baby.I did not watch the video, but did read the sling chapter in the Baby Book, which was helpful. We have recently started using the kangaroo (facing out) position as the baby loves looking at the outside world now. It's nice to have this sort of flexibility.  If you are getting tired carrying around your baby, and would like an extra hand free, a sling is a great investment and while not the most elegant, the NoJo is a good workhorse one to use on a daily basis.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Lifesaver for Reflux Baby/Tendonitis Mom', 'unixReviewTime': 1059523200, 'reviewTime': '07 30, 2003'}

I was looking for a baby carrier that I could wear while nursing her that would be comfortable and discreet.  Initially, I found the sling very awkward to use.

Our daughter was colicy, and being able to put her in the sling all cozied up to either myself or my husband, hands free, was a God send.  This calmed her 90% of the time.  As the months went by, being able to wear her in the sling enabled me to get housework done without baby crying to be picked up - she was already up, and was able to be &quot;involved&quot; in my daily activities this way.There are many different ways to wear your baby in the sling, and that versatility has made it one of the best baby product purchases we made.  Our daughter is now 2 1/2 (30+ lbs.), and when she's having a rough &quot;toddler day&quot; will still occasionally ask for the sling.Be patient with the sling.  Practice with it, and if you can, find a friend who has used one successfully.  Dr. Sears also has a whole chapter on using a sling (any sling, not just this brand) in his book The Baby Book - great photos in there to help get the hang of things.One last remark... I have a friend who tried this sling and was unable to get it tight around her body (she's very petite).

My first was very small, and as a newborn, I thought he seemed lost in the sling so I exchanged it for a front-pack carrier.  Now I know that you can put a blanket or such in the sling to help cradle a newborn more securely.  It was a lost opportunity for us.  With the arrival of my second child, I decided to give it another try, as many of my friends raved about theirs and I'd need my hands free for my first child still.  I found the sling to be great for nursing, and afforded me privacy when I had to do so while out and about as I could pull the sling's fabric right over the baby and cover us both.  For a tired baby, it is much more conducive to sleeping than an upright carrier, and you can slip out of it and lay the baby down while still in the sling, if necessary.  My third child was (and still is) very cuddly, and enjoyed being next to me.  Since a mom's arms tire after a while, I found the sling a great way to incorporate baby into my routine without wearing myself out.  My fourth child turned our world upside-down with a very colicky start.  The &quot;insert-in-sling-and-go&quot; method was the only way to settle him down.  I could nurse, cook supper, do whatever I needed to do while keeping him close and moving, which was the key.  He learned to relax and even sleep while I was doing all sorts of things and making quite a racket at times.  Now at nearly three, he'll fall asleep while I'm driving and I can take him into the house, remove his coat and shoes, then carry him upstairs to bed without disturbing him.  I believe his learning to relax and sleep in the sling with so much going on around him has helped him in this area, too.  Most of all, it is just nice to have that close time with your little one in the sling, even if you are busy with other things to do.

If he\'s particularly fussy, I can put him in it and he goes right to sleep.HOWEVER, despite its claims this carrier is NOT more comfortable than traditional carriers.  Even with a small baby (my son was a month old and barely 8 lbs when we started using the sling) all of the weight goes onto 1 shoulder, thus quickly straining that shoulder and causing tension to both your shoulder and neck - not a pleasant experience if you\'re out and about with baby.  My husband complained of the same thing when he used the sling.  On the other hand, if you wear it correctly a traditional carrier distributes the weight between your two shoulders allowing you to go for a longer period of time before you start feeling a strain.One of the principle reasons that I bought a baby sling as opposed to a traditional carrier was its claim that you can breast-feed discretely while wearing it.  I can see how this would be true for anyone who is small to average breasted (say, up to a "b" or maybe even "c" cup); but if you\'re larger than that it\'s physically impossible - trust me, I tried it every way imaginable!Another issue for me is the security of the sling.  Apart from being able to snuggle with my son, I also wanted a way to be able to hold him while doing some household chores.  That\'s impossible with a sling.  The moment you take your hands off it you feel like your baby\'s going to fall right out - although he\'s snuggled down into it, the sling feels like it will "tip over" if you release it.  Even the product picture shows the woman with her hand underneath the sling - so no hands free!  With the carrier I have now I can even cook while wearing my baby - I just switch him to the back and wear the carrier like a backpack.  And I don\'t have to worry about him falling out of it, so I truly do have both hands free.Bottom line, the baby sling is good for some extra support while cuddling with baby, but not very practical otherwise.P.S.  I WILL admit that the sling is great if you go some place cold, like the snow.
