Both had major design flaws in my view. I would not recommend either to anyone.This gate's latching mechanism is too complicated and made of cheap plastic. There is a small button that you need to press every time you open the gate. If you don't, the latch breaks. Without fail, everyone who tries to open the gate for the first time doesn't press the button. Just a matter of time before it breaks. It's also difficult to open with one hand.The Safeway gate claims that it only opens in one direction to prevent it from opening over the stairs. The mechanism used to do this is two little plastic nubs that are insufficient for the job. It was very easy to push the gate over the stairs, with only minor resistance.I am an engineer and installed both gates absolutely correctly.Do not buy these gates.

The gates also do not stay open, they self close, which is very frustrating.  The self closing also tend to trap my children between the gate and the extension since it will allow the child to close the gate on themselves but won't allow then to open it once half closed.

Berliner', 'helpful': [4, 4], 'reviewText': 'I reluctantly purchased this gate after reading some of the 1 star reviews, and I was very careful unpacking it, because I wanted to be ready to return it.  Let me start off by saying, "There is nothing wrong with this gate."  Could this gate have more features? yes... like an alarm if you leave it open, or a spring that automatically closes it behind you, but this gate works fine.To those who don\'t like stubbing your toe... don\'t get a pressure mount gate... however on the bottom of the stairs, to stubbing is highly unlikely... toe stubbing happens at the top of the stairs, and usually while climbing the stairs.  "Stub my toe once, shame on you, stub my toe twice, shame on me."For those who are concerned that it falls apart...  I\'ve had it for a couple of months now... I was worried about the plastic latch, but it seems to work fine, I would expect it to last the 2 years or so until the baby is safe on the stairs.  I will update if it breaks.For those of you concerned that the baby will open the gate when it is locked... not if installed properly.  The instructions are poorly written.  They could be more clear.  Their tension gauge is a waste.  Here\'s what you do:  Install the gate, until the pressure holds it where you want.  Close the gate, and lock the latch.  Pull/push up on the door with the approximate strength of your kid.  If the door moves, you need to add more tension.  As a result, I would be careful installing it against drywall if it is at a midpoint between two studs... I have one side against drywall, and I haven\'t had a problem.ADDENDUM: I was thinking about increasing my rating to 5 stars, but I\'m afraid you\'ll take me less seriously.  We\'ve had the gate for about 5 months, and there is no signs that the gate is going to fall apart as some people have reported.  My 17 month old has figured out how to close and lock the gate (very cute) but she can\'t open it.  If the gate is kept open a lot, the pressure is not kept on the pads, so the gate has a tendency to drift... but not a lot, and that is easy to fix.One surprise complaint.  The locking mechanism "clicks" shut.  I have a 9 year old who sleeps near the gate.  I\'m afraid to lock the gate at night when I go downstairs as I am afraid the loud click will wake my other daughter.ADDENDUM: I was going through my reviews and came across this old one.  Just letting you know that this gate worked fine right up to the point when I took it down because I didn\'t need it anymore.  Can\'t remember exactly when we took it down, but my baby was somewhere between 30-36 months.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Nothing wrong with this gate', 'unixReviewTime': 1270944000, 'reviewTime': '04 11, 2010'}

Jordan', 'helpful': [336, 338], 'reviewText': 'After trying 3 different gates (that all had high ratings on Amazon), this is my favorite.  I turned my home into my own version of a baby gate showroom to figure out which one I wanted, so here\'s my take on three different gates.I think they are all pretty good gates, it just depends on your situation and what features you\'re looking for.  The key features that ended up making a difference to me were 1) the width of the gate opening and  2) the latch mechanismKidco Center Gateway:---------------------cost $85 & extensions $24  / gate is 29.5" Tall  / fits 29.25" to 37.5" doorway width  / 1" bar to step over / gate opening 22"-  Has the widest gate opening (the space you walk thru, not the doorway that it fits into) of any of them - about 22".  (This certainly won points from my 6\'2" husband who was pretty irritated when walking thru some of the others).  I was surprised after reading so many reviews on all these gates that there wasn\'t more mention of this feature.-  This one also had the most secure latch feature.  You have to push a button to lift the handle and lift the gate over a little ledge to open it and walk thru.  I figure this will absolutely be the hardest one for my little one to figure out.- This gate has the most adjustable widths and therefore would probably be the strongest in most door widths.  The gate has about 2.75" pieces on the ends that you can use or not with the optional extensions (more 2.75" spindles as additions - 2 per box) to provide the most width flexibility.  Because all the gates become "weaker" if the posts are extended too much, this one seems the sturdiest in my doorways. (ie. if the gate says it fits up to 37" and your door opening is 36.5", it won\'t seem as sturdy as if the doorway was 34").-  It doesn\'t have its brand name printed on it anywhere (a plus in my book) so it\'s totally white.-  It has the lowest bar across the floor that you have to step over at only 1" high (seems less of a tripping risk).-  This is the one that has the highest rating from Consumer Reports.  (Child safety gates 08/04)-  Unfortunately, it also is the most expensive of the bunch at about $85 + any extensions you need.-  I do have to say that this one had the most confusing directions, but you can still figure it out ok - none of them took longer than 10 minutes to set up.-  It\'s the shortest gate and I wish it was a little taller.-  All in all, if you can afford the price of this one, it\'s definitely worth it!Summer Infant - Sure & Secure Extra Tall Gate---------------------------------------------cost $60 & extensions included  / gate is 36" Tall / fits 28"-48" doorway width / 2" bar to step over / gate opening 19"-  This is the one that I wanted to like because I thought it was the best deal.-  The gate opening is about 19" - which I thought was ok, but hubby wanted wider.-  The latch mechanism is really easy to operate and I thought kids could figure it out easily, but because the gate is so tall, they would probably have a hard time reaching it.-  It does come with its own extensions in 5" and 10" so it more easily fits the wider doorways.-  However, depending on the width of your doorway, this one may or may not fit as well.  For example, I had a lot of doorways that are about 33" and this gate didn\'t end up fitting well in them because the gate without any extensions was too small and the posts had to be extended so far it didn\'t seem stable.  And the 5" extension was too big to add.  (vs. the kidco gate\'s extensions add 2.75" as needed).-  It\'s by far the tallest and I liked that since my daughter has been in the 95% so far.  I also just like the way the taller gate looks.-  It does have the highest bar across the bottom to step over - 2".-  If it fits well in your doorway it is probably the best value for the money.First Years - Hands-Free Gate-----------------------------cost $50 & extensions $15 / gate is 32" Tall  / fits 29"-34" doorway width / 1.5" bar to step over / gate opening 17"- My gripe with this gate was primarily because the gate opening is only 17" wide! I\'m 5\'8" and I felt like I was going to have to really pay attention walking through it so I wouldn\'t end up bumping it every time.  However...- The hands-free step pedal is pretty cool and worked pretty easily. I wouldn\'t worry about a little kid figuring it out and having enough weight to be able to push it down to open it. For me it just wasn\'t cool enough to overcome my issue with the gate opening width.- Good height to the gate.- It was very sturdy in my doorway.- This one did have a little ramp feature for the bar that goes across the floor that helps minimize the tripping factor.- Fits only up to 34" doorways so has the best chance of needing an extension.-  All that being said, if you really want a hands free gate, and the width of the gate opening doesn\'t bug you, try this one.All three gates seemed to:- Fit pretty tightly in the doorways after being adjusted properly.  Depending on your walls and if you have moldings etc, you might need to take an extra 5-10 minutes to adjust them and get them straight and hanging correctly.- Had the same type of post for the pressure-mount that is covered with a rubbery material to help it not slip on the wall.- Were pretty easy to set up.- All look about the same from a quality point of view - in other words one of them didn\'t look "cheaper" to me than the others.Please remember that for safety, only hardware mounted gates are considered stable enough to put at the top of stairs, so don\'t use any of these for that.

It is very easy, for an adult, to open, yet keeps our 15 month old safe on the other side.  It also has a nice feature that doesn\'t allow the door to open when it is closed but not locked.  This is a good feature in case you accidently do not lock it properly.We\'ve had this product for about 1 month now and are extremely satisfied.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a sturdy safety gate that is easy to open and close.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Perfect for our family', 'unixReviewTime': 1280620800, 'reviewTime': '08 1, 2010'}

I highly recommend you install it in a doorway so the pressure mount will be against solid wood or something of the sort. If you set this up on drywall without knowing where a stud is, you'll probably damage your walls.The one catch is the instructions are very oddly arranged, with the directions in multiple languages in one part, and the corresponding diagrams in a totally different section, so you end up flipping back and forth trying to comprehend it all. Despite that, the directions are actually pretty sound and rather well written, it just takes a little time to comprehend. Don't let the this discourage you though, the effort is well worth it. It also comes with 2 extensions in the box, which came in handy for me. The walk-thru opening is wide enough for a large adult to walk through without a problem, we've actually even had moving men walk through it while carring a king-size mattress with no problem. The bar at the bottom that you have to step over is pretty low and out of the way, we've never had anyone trip on it.

Let me start by saying that their products are some of the safest out there and I have every confidence in the security of the gates I have installed. BUT, the first gate I purchased was the standard gateway that uses hardware to install.  You can see my review there but the thing that is pertinent here is that they only included limited hardware in the box which would not work safely if installing the gate into dry wall (even when there is a stud).  So, instead of including another set of screws that would've cost them about $0.90, Kidco likes to make busy parents go buy that stuff themselves.Well, this gate has its own torturous surprise for busy parents who are trying to multitask every hour of the day.  Kidco kindly includes two extensions making this gate much more versitile than most on the market.  The thing they don't tell you is that these extensions are held in by the same tension that holds the gate into the wall.  Each of these tension screws are completely separate from one another (which is good design because it allows installation over uneaven surfaces).  However, because there is no mechanism holding these extensions into place, this means that the parent installing the gate must use two hands to hold up the gate, make sure each of the 4 separate extension brackets and two separate support bars, and the 4 metal extension bars which the brackets slide over (none of which lockinto place in anyway) don't fall off, all the while trying to tighten one tension screw at a time...  I cannot even explain to you how two limbs are not enough to get the job done and still remain sane by the end of the process.Throw me a bone Kidco!  How about the brackets clip or screw that holds the brackets into place so they don't slide off while I'm trying to mount the gate?  Something!?!Unfortunately, you will find that Kidco often makes the best products for this kind of thing but they sure do cut corners on the little stuff that would make a parent's life a LOT easier.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Kidco likes to make things difficult for busy parents', 'unixReviewTime': 1246147200, 'reviewTime': '06 28, 2009'}

{'reviewerID': 'ARGZ3Z0938IR1', 'asin': 'B000058DJL', 'reviewerName': 'Vivian Singer', 'helpful': [4, 4], 'reviewText': 'This was the only gate I could find that met all my criteria: it is wide enough for the opening and short enough to fit against a low wall, it doesn\'t make permanent marks in the wall, and it looked very sturdy. When it arrived, I was very happy with the solid feel and the easy installation. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and all four "feet" that fit against the wall are independently adjustable - very important for baseboards. The top ones are round, for maximum contact, but the bottom ones have one flat edge, which fit perfectly along the top of the little molding at the bottom of our baseboards.The gate is really easy for an adult to open, but difficult for a small child. Not only does it require pushing in a stiff button and lifting a little arm, but you also have to lift the entire center gate a half inch. You can do it all with one hand, and it\'s not obvious to a little one how it works (this kid already tries to push on the foot pedal on another gate).The only downside is that the gate just opens 90 degrees. If it swung farther, the open end would reach the wall. We leave it open most of the time, because it\'s only for when our littlest grandchild visits, and it would be nicer not to have to dodge the end when coming through.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Terrific baby gate', 'unixReviewTime': 1284854400, 'reviewTime': '09 19, 2010'}

I am a weekly customer and always receive top notch service and products from Amazon and the marketplace.The item received was horrible.  It is flimsy and doesn\'t work well at all.  I tried to put it up and felt that it was absolutely a safety hazard for our child.  There is no doubt that he could topple this and fall down the stairs.  After days of waiting for a response, the first response was "tell us more".  The second response was "you will have to pay for return shipping AND a restocking fee".Not to mention, the photo shows 3 extensions and they only ship 2.  That is also deceptive advertising and should not be allowed by such a great company.  Horrible.  Try the Dreambaby products.

{'reviewerID': 'A2E3J7LGLG0J3P', 'asin': 'B000058DJL', 'reviewerName': 'wcw', 'helpful': [5, 6], 'reviewText': 'After reading the negative reviews, there seem to be three camps of people who don\'t like the product.One group has uber-intelligent children, who figure out how to depress the button and lift up on the latch simultaneously, thereby allowing the child to escape. Tragically, while these children are mechanically inclined, they are not intelligent enough to resist the urge to pursue dangerous escapes.The second group is too unintelligent or impatient (as adults) to handle the exact same latching mechanism, or to step over a small bar. Hence they break the handle, and trip over the small lower anchor bar. This is tragic for both the parents and the children for so many reasons.The third group is deceived by the admittedly ambiguous instructions. You need to have this gate in a door frame or spanning between against two strong vertical surfaces. Then you need to crank the heck out of the compression "bolts"  to ensure a very high degree of pressure. If you try to put it up against drywall, you will poke through the drywall. If you do not make the gate VERY tightly lodged, it will fall over, probably on your child as they try to climb on it.So, there are some legitimate problems with the gate. But, installed correctly and in a house of moderate intelligence on both the adult and child front, it should be just fine.I am of moderate intelligence, as are my offspring, and we have managed to make it work in three separate houses with only minor annoyance.YMMV.Update: Customer service was very responsive and nice when I needed to get a few replacement parts that got lost in a recent move.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Works just fine', 'unixReviewTime': 1330732800, 'reviewTime': '03 3, 2012'}
