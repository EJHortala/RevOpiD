This is fine if you are also installing a junction box at the same time.  You can turn the junction box to aim the light as you wish.However, if you have an existing junction box which is securely installed, the screw fittings on that box are unlikely to position the light in the correct orientation.Solution:  Use a metal strip to connect 2 opposing fittings on the junction box; drill a hole in the center of that strip; drill a hole in the center of the light fixture; use a screw/bolt to pass through the light fixture and the metal stripNet Result:  Light fixture is held in place by a single screw/bolt in the center, allowing the fixture to be fine-tuned in its orientation.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great Value', 'unixReviewTime': 1358294400, 'reviewTime': '01 16, 2013'}

{'reviewerID': 'A23NSKTMSPPBTR', 'asin': 'B00002N5E0', 'reviewerName': 'Wayne', 'helpful': [77, 78], 'reviewText': 'Heath Zenith has a variety of motion sensor lights ranging from this one to ones many times the price. This one works very well for my purposes, and models that are many times the cost or from different manufacturers offer no advantage to me in that respect.  There are many similarities between this and similar motion sensor lights, but it\'s the differences that are relevant in deciding which one to buy.The basic sensor and associated circuitry is a relatively inexpensive part, and I doubt that there is a difference between the one used in this model and the one used in models many times more expensive. But others use multiple sensors and/or multiple areas with sensor elements. This one has a four way switch, allowing you to set fixed increments of 1, 5, or 10 minutes of "on time" when the unit is activated. There is also a test position that is handy for setup.  Lights I have from another manufacturer have a continuous range using a small knob. My other lights also have an "accent" knob, which I won\'t describe since this unit lacks one. The on/off feature uses your wall switch, and flicking that off and on within a second will switch this to manual mode, if you want the light left on. I\'d recommend aValue Pack Switch Guardor a similar product regardless of which motion sensor light you get, since it\'s easy for you or guests to cause the light to stay off or on all night. The side opening to the switch guard still leaves you with easy access if you need it. On very rare occasions, those can be found cheaply at major home improvement chains. If you can get free shipping, so much the better.This security light has a lightweight plastic housing, which is not going to rust. I don\'t know if it will degrade over time, but aside from the sensor, this can be painted to match your house. Setup is very easy. Aside from needing to clear the screw holes with a drill, all you need is a screwdriver. The "holes" you don\'t use are left sealed. Chances are you can install it without even looking at the instructions. The initial 90 second setup process is automatic.The sensor is designed to work within a 3,400 foot range, while slightly more expensive ones offer double that range. In an urban area such as mine, this one offers more than what I need, and could be a possible advantage to those who claim other models are triggered too easily. The 110 degree range of detection is sufficient, but the detector is mounted from the same plate as the bulb holders. That makes it difficult to position the bulbs without blocking the sensor, especially if this is mounted in a corner, such as next to a chimney or door. My other lights also have an additional downward sensor near where the switch area is on this model, which could help depending on your needs. On them, the sensor hangs several inches below the housing, making it possible to point bulbs in more positions without them getting in front of the sensor.The housing does not encase the bulbs, which I find aesthetically less pleasing. I have no idea whether it affects bulb life, but it will allow bulbs to get dirty and will not keep rain away from the socket on windy days. Bulbs are not included, which for me is an advantage since I use ones with fluorescent elements and it was wasteful when I bought other brands that included bulbs.I have this mounted in a side yard, with a nearby fence and no access to anything but a three small trees and a vegetable bed. I can\'t see any advantage to anything better. The fixed time settings are good enough for me. You can get a more expensive model with in between settings if for example it takes you 1 1/2 half minutes to wheel the trash to the curb and get back to the door, which could be an inconvenience if you want your normal setting to be 60 seconds and don\'t want to be in the dark while out of range. So consider your own circumstances if your needs are very specific.If you want the lights to go on when you cat goes to the door, get a different model with an extra downward sensor window. If you want to prevent that, this saves you the trouble of one more adjustment and saves the cost of things you don\'t need. In summary, this works as well as I need and could be a perfect solution for you, but it\'s how you use it, not the "quality" of the product that really matters.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Budget product with non-budget performance', 'unixReviewTime': 1276473600, 'reviewTime': '06 14, 2010'}

One was working great for about 3 weeks, and now it turns on sometimes, and not at other times.

Then recently, on few occasions, it turns on, but one has to be a few feet away, even though it is set to high sensitivity.  The other installed unit appears to have a broken sensitivity button.  It is too sensitive and turns on repeatedly without noticeable motion changes.  Cheap price, but not worth it if it does not work.  Going to install the 3rd unit I purchased to replace one of the installed two units.
