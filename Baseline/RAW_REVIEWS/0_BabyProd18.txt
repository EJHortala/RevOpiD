It can be used with just about any kind of buckle/harness including 5 point, 3 point, and typical swing belts.Despite information posted by other reviewers, I would like to note that this item is safe for use in car seats.  It is designed so that the padding is to the side of the baby and NOT behind the baby.  This is stated on the packaging: "Safe for use in all car seats, Snuzzler is specially designed with padding only on the sides of baby\'s head and body, not in back of baby, for proper harness fit."  This meets the requirements of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration which states "Never place any extra cushioning under or behind your baby. This also prevents harness straps from being snug."  The NHTSA also recommends using towels to support baby\'s head and neck, but the Snuzzler stays in place better because of its design and, therefore, in my opinion, would be safer to use than towels.Also, the NHTSA recommends not putting jackets and heavy clothes on your baby in a carseat because this also prevents harness straps from fitting properly.  The Snuzzler is designed with warm fabric on one side and a cooler feeling fabric on the other side to accomodate seasons, keeping baby warmer in colder temperatures and cooler in warmer temperatures, decreasing the need for bulky coats and clothing in the winter.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'No more slumping babe', 'unixReviewTime': 1099180800, 'reviewTime': '10 31, 2004'}

It is nice and soft and cuddly, and made of much nicer fabric than that ghastly polyester grayco liner, but I did not find it helpful and I did not find that it positioned my baby any better than she was in the carseat on her own.My main concern with this product is not that my baby will fly out of her carseat in a crash as warned by the 1-star reviews, my concern is that this did not prevent her head from flopping FORWARD -- infact, it was difficult for me to position the head pillow in a way that didn't make forward-flopping worse.  This chin-to-chest posture can restrict airflow.  Newborns can't necessarily protest or lift their heads to compensate when they're being deprived of oxygen.  I was warned about this at my baby-carrier group (before the sling recall, where some of the babies died for this exact reason) and it was something I worried about when my daughter was young because her head seemed to always fall forward in the carseat, even when it said it was well-positioned.I would not recommend this product to a new parent.  It looks really cozy, but it didn't stop my daughter's head from flopping in the direction I consider most dangerous, and it really only even fit around her in her carseat for a matter of weeks anyway.

The sides are really what support the baby, much like rolling up blankets and placing beside baby in the car seat.  There are openings for the straps of the safety harness so they are not hindered in any way.I recommend this product 100%!  It is awesome and has made things so much more comfy for our baby.  He's 3 months now so we use the Snuzzler in his swing but we used it the first two months in his car seat.  The support it provided stabilized his little body in a car seat that seemed to swallow him up.I love that it is reversible so you can use the warm fleece side during the winter &amp; the cotton side during the warmer seasons.Trust me you'll love it!  I'm so glad someone recommended it to me.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Comfort for newborns+!  A must have.  It IS safe.', 'unixReviewTime': 1076803200, 'reviewTime': '02 15, 2004'}

I bought it to use in my Baby Jogger stroller and it works wonderfully.  There is actually a Snuzzler designed specifically for Baby Jogger which costs more.  This is the same product without the Baby Jogger brand name and costs almost $15 less!  I gave only 4 stars because the head support is kind of thick and pushed my baby's head forward, so I removed it.  But she was already 3 months old when I bought it, so it might work well for newborns.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Very good product for Baby Jogger Stroller', 'unixReviewTime': 1155427200, 'reviewTime': '08 13, 2006'}

She is almost 15 pounds now and we are still using it.Snuzzler provides the ultimate support and "hugs" the baby in all the right places, so the little one feels secure and comfortable. We also use one in the stroller - for extra padding. I like that it\'s adjustable and will grow with the baby, and the design allows it to be used virtually anywhere - in the car seat, stroller, swing, high chair - you name it! It may even be used as a sleep positioner in the crib to prevent the baby from rolling over.We use our Snuzzler every day and it doesn\'t show any wear at all. It washes well (doesn\'t shrink, bunch, fade or pill) and may well serve more than one baby.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Not just for tiny babies...', 'unixReviewTime': 1124668800, 'reviewTime': '08 22, 2005'}

An hour later, the respiratory therapist came back and said he passed with flying colors... especially with the "little infant support" I had placed in the car seat.  They said it really supported his little body and allowed his head and torso to stay in position exactly as it should.  Further, they said it worked a lot better than the head supports that usually come with the car seat because it not only held his head in place, but it kept his torso from leaning to one side or the other.What a great product!
