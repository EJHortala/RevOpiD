The design is sturdy and fits our power strip perfectly, it is also easy to put  together. But it has two big minuses:1. Its height. The wires can bend but this is about 1 inch higher than the plugs, so if you want this to go under a piece of furniture you may want to consider whether it fits under or not. It barely fits under our chest.2. THE REAL ISSUE: The width of the slot through which the cables come out. MY TODDLER's HAND AND A PORTION OF HIS ARM fit through the slot perfectly, so he can reach the outlets AND the switch of the power cord. What is the point of this item? We just hope, at this point, that it will be a further discouragement--and since the piece is all but wedged under the chest, we will get to him before he can pull the thing close enough to stick his little hand in. Hopefully we'll find something better soon.You can presumably use it by covering every unused outlet in the cord with outlet covers. Although the toddler will be able to reach in, he will probably not have the strength or dexterity to pull out the outlet covers while his hand movements are limited by this shell. This, of course, would not stop him/her from turning the switch off--in our case, this means resetting the clock and being without a phone for however long it takes us to notice the deed, among other bothers.In summary: buy it only if you mean to attach it to the wall.

The slot where the cords for the equipment come out is 5/8"-1" wide and a maximum of 10-3/4" long.  When closed, the hole for the power strip cord is 1-3/8" by 1/2".  Holes are provided in the base for wall mounting, but no accessories are provided.To open the thing, you press two tabs on the inner lower cover, then slide off the outer cover, then lift the inner top cover.  Place the power strip into the inner lower cover, then replace the inner top cover, then slide the inner cover into the outer cover.The plastic is stiffer compared with the Mommy\'s Helper model, but it also seems more brittle.  I don\'t like the fact that there is no way to flick the power strip switch without half-disassembling the thing. It can hold a wider and higher strip and transformers than the Mommy\'s Helper model by about 3/4" in either direction, which is nice.

The locking mechanisms are effective in keeping it closed while in little, curious hands.As per the reviews that say the opening on top is wide enough for little hands to enter, they're absolutely correct (my hands will almost fit inside so baby hands slip in without a problem).  However, we covered unused outlets on the cord with the simple plastic covers and then put these on.  No safety precaution can be 100% - but between the individual outlets being covered and the whole strip being covered, we feel confident our little guy will not be able to out-smart the entire contraption before we see what he's trying to do and intervene.My only complaint is that more color options weren't available.

This product prevents her from unplugging my electronic devices, from trying to plug things into the power strip, and from flipping the power strip into the off position.  It keeps my child and my electronics safe!My only critique of this item is that it seems a bit flimsy when fully extended.  The power strip for my entertainment center is a pretty standard length and size and fits in this strip cover with the cover extended fully.  When extended, the cover can wiggle, and if wiggled enough, little hands could possibly figure out how to separate the two pieces, thus gaining access to the power strip.  In an effort to avoid this scenario, I have placed the product placed far enough under my entertainment center that my child would really have to reach to get to it, so the level of concentration that it would take her to both reach for the power strip and open the cover is beyond what she is capable of doing.I am still satsified with this product despite its weakness when fully extended, however, because when I placed the bare power strip in the exact same location, my daughter had no problem both reaching for the power strip and flicking it into the off position.  Furthermore, seeing all those cords, outlets, and plugs motivated her to move the power strip to where she could reach it better and within a matter of moments, she would happily turning it on and off, unplugging things, and trying to "plug" foreign objects into it.  So another thing this product succeeds in doing is making the power strip less attractive for her by covering up all the things she likes most about them- buttons, plug ins, and outlets.If this device were more readily accessible (ie: out in the open) I think my daughter would have no problem figuring out how to open it and thus rendering it useless.
