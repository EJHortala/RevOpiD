The avocado/oatmeal combination is great, especially if you\'re like me and have sensitive/combination skin.  I like using the clay masks because they are much easier to remove than the ones that "peel".  After I use the mask, my skin is amazingly soft and supple, like brand new.  It usually takes about 10-15 minutes for it to dry and then I can wipe it off clean with warm water and a wet cloth.  I like to do it before I go to bed because it does make your skin "glow" a bit afterwards and this way my skin has time to fully absorb the nutrients and relax.  I really like that "a little goes a long way", so one bottle lasts quite a while. Also, if you feel you might have a pimple coming on, I dab a little on the area, let it dry and clean it off.  This helps to calm the affected area and sometimes avoid a pimple altogether.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Works nicely on sensitive skin', 'unixReviewTime': 1331596800, 'reviewTime': '03 13, 2012'}

Not a big deal, I use Dove Men's Sensitive Face Lotion after ANY facial cleaning productSide Notes- if you live near a Walmart, buy from there. It's so much cheaper than Amazon, I got it for 3.27 compared to 6.63 on Amazon. Same 6oz, same product- personally, I use twice a week per instructions. Using more often might cause irritation and actually worsen your skin- I let it sit on my skin for a solid 20 minutes to get rid of dirt and oil", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Highly recommended - cheaper at Walmart', 'unixReviewTime': 1404950400, 'reviewTime': '07 10, 2014'}
