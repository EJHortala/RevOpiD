My old product still worked, but had gotten worn and dirty looking, even though I had cleaned it.  I am very disappointed in the replacement model. The plug on the new model is much larger and heavier than the old plug.  It will not stay firmly in the outlet and is prone to falling out.  It works a little better if I plug it into the upper outlet, but I have to keep my curling iron plugged into that one because the plug covers the lower outlet.  If I put the plug into the lower outlet there is too much space between the plug and the outlet cover near the bottom of the plug, making the plug unwieldly and even more prone to falling out of the socket than when it is plugged into the upper socket.  I actually had to build up the lower part of the plug with foam board and cover it with tape to fill in that space.  There is only one outlet in the room, so I don\'t have an optional outlet for each appliance.An additional but important problem with the plug is that it is 8 1/2" shorter than the old plug, which is a big difference!  It really cuts down on the reach cabability of the dryer, making the plug even more unstable.  I would have given the product top star rating if it had a plug like my old model.  I can\'t return the item because I cut off the warning labels (which I know you aren\'t supposed to do, but I know the safety hazards and don\'t have any children around to worry about).  Other than the plug problem, the dryer works well, is fairly quiet, and folds for easy packing and less space used in a drawer, which is the main reason I liked my original dryer.I don\'t know why they changed the plug.  I really wish that when manufacturers have a good product that it is just left alone, or at least checked to be sure that the specifications and qualties are the same in every product.
