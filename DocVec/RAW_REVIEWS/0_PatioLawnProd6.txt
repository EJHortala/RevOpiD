In an attempt to reduce surface evaporation, I ordered this for my yard and garden.This gadget does a great job at getting the water to the roots where the plants can best utilize it.  I also discovered that it makes a great &#34;aerator&#34; since the water loosens the soil as you press it in (whether this is truly effective, I cannot ascertain - for all I know, the water makes the feeder go in easier, but when withdrawn the soil could just fill back in; however, I do notice my plants thriving)Two quirks about the device, that make me question the durability:1. The hose connection and the valve switch.  It does not seem reinforced enough. As such I leave this device connected to my hose reel.  The valve switch seems a bit flimsy which leads me to suspect that this may not hold its position over time.2. The fertilizer compartment seal.  When I first got this and tried using it, water squirted out of the fertilizer cap.  I had to reseat the seal and tighten the top twice - the seal doesn't like to stay in place.  Given this fact, I don't think I would fertilize via this route - I would probably use plant spikes and this device to help dig into the soil to place the spikes.Apart from the two quirks I find this device quite useful for the garden and much more effective at delivering water deeply without wasting water (versus watering the surface and having the water diffuse down).  Had it not been for my area's watering restrictions, I probably would not have sought out this product.  Having used it - I am pleased, and I do feel like I waste less water by not spraying the surface of beds and having it just evaporate.  Definitely room for improvement, but otherwise a decent product.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great product - but not sure about the durability', 'unixReviewTime': 1402358400, 'reviewTime': '06 10, 2014'}

The soil is very poor. There is topsoil down to about 6 inches, then a 12 inch layer of "Calichi" (hardpan), then silty soil below that. Water does not penetrate the calichi layer.I have grass planted with a sprinkler system. When the sprinklers go on, the soil becomes saturated quickly because surface water does not penetrate the calichi layer. Trees planted in the lawn do not get enough water. The root feeder is the perfect tool to water trees by getting water below the calichi layer. The root feeder will not by itself penetrate the calichi layer so I first have to prepare a hole by driving a 3/8 reinforcing bar into the ground to get past the calichi layer. I then withdraw the re-bar and insert the root feeder. My one complaint is that the threads conecting the plastic handle to the metal rod are too fine, and as a result, after much use the rod separates from the plastic handle. I solve this problem by wrapping the rod threads with Teflon tape.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Root Feeder', 'unixReviewTime': 1215216000, 'reviewTime': '07 5, 2008'}

I also buy the shrub and tree food refills that go in the top of the root feeder to add supplements to the root system. These have made a noticeable difference in the health of my trees and shrubs. It also helps you use far less water by putting the water in the ground instead of ON the ground and relying on absorption to get the job done. The plants are much more responsive.

But if you handle it carefully, and carry it around by the putting your hand on the hose instead of the plastic body it should work just fine.

It's also out of warranty as I bought it early last year. I have a possible solution that might prevent his from happening to others.When this product worked for me it worked VERY well. It put fertilizer right where I needed it and this year my wife's roses look great.The weakest part of this unit is where the garden hose connects. I am a stickler for making sure the connections are not cross threaded and I had this one on tight when all at once the hose just popped out of the connector. I put it back on making sure that it was tight but not overtightened. Again the hose popped out. When I attempted to reattach the hose the third time the connector would not accept the hose fittings. It cannot be used at all now.I think part of what caused my problem was me carrying the unit around with the garden hose attached. Be sure and disconnect the hose after use.If I were to purchase another I will attach a garden hose shut-off valve on it. That way I will not ruin the threads on the unit by constantly attaching and removing a garden hose from the unit itself I would be attaching it to the shut off valve instead.If you are tempted to carry the unit around anyway with a garden hose attached I might have a solution for that too. I'd attach shut-off valve to the unit and reinforce it with duct tape. Maybe even wrap the tape around a couple of wooden dowels.

Some Coulmnar Sweedish Aspens, some Maples, some Birch trees etc.  My family loves trees so we have really loaded the yard and it is turning into a real garden paradise back there.  However I worried about the trees making it and wanted to make sure I gave them the very best shot they could have at living and flourishing.  After all it is enough of a pain to dig a proper hole for a 15 gallon tree, having to do it 2 1/2 times (1 to plant, 1 to remove, and then clear it out enough to get a replacement tree in there) warranted the cost of trying to use something like this.I also purchased the fertilizer &#34;bars&#34; that are necessary for the types of trees that I planted here on Amazon.  I read the directions, I know I know not very adult of me but I wanted the give the trees the best shot.  Was surprised to read that even tho the bar is about 24&#34; long you should only push it into the ground 12&#34; for a more mature tree and 6&#34; for a new smaller tree.  As I had both I have tried both.I got it in place at the drip-line surrounding the tree.  Well to be honest I kind of cheated.  Having just planted the tress I could tell right where the dig line had been as there is no grass in that location.  So I measured and just kind of eyeballed the depth.  I worked my way around the tree line following the directions and used a bunch of the little bars as needed.While I can't guarantee it was the cause, as well they are living things and vary as a result, the aspens basically doubled in height the first year and put on about 6', yes that is feet, in height.  This second year in the ground they have done about another 4'.  And are really starting to provide a wall of green and some shade in the setting sun.The Autumn Blaze Maples have shown less vigor than the Aspens, but they are all alive and seem to be doing well.  They were larger trees and in my experience they take longer to get their root systems establishes than the smaller trees.  I was trying to short circuit that with larger trees but should probably have just bough the smaller younger trees.In any event all are doing well and have survived the snows of winter, and the raging heat of summer.The Ross root feeder is very easy to use.  I turn off the value on the handle, and turn on the water at the spigot.  Then I walk to where water is needed and I push it into the ground to the right depth.  Open the clear cap on top with just a few twists and then put in the fertilizer and replace the cap.  (As a side note I have only ever used the Ross the pellets with it but they work and so I am happy with it.)  I then found a small trick.  i pull the Ross Root Feeder back up about 1/4 of an inch.  Just a slight lifting.  Then I open the value and look and listen for water flow.  Some times with the soil around here it was block and no water would flow.  With the slight lift the never happens.  I don't typically open the valve all the way and instead only open it about 3/4s of the way.It takes a while to dissolve the fertilizer pellet so I set a timer I stole, I mean borrowed, from the kitchen and let it run for the amount of time I wanted in each position.Then I lather rinse and repeat the process.  Turn off the valve, pull it out of the ground, walk to a new place, push it in to the right depth, uncap add a pellet recap, lift up slightly, turn on the valve to about 3/4s and start the timer counting down again.It does seem to help and it definitely gets water down past the flowers and other plants that surround some of the trees.For me it was a great purchase and I would do it again and have recommend it to others.  This one is actually my second one.  The first one was going strong a decade ago when I  bought it for my first home.  But 3 moves later... it was just gone so it was time to replace it.The only con I can think of?
