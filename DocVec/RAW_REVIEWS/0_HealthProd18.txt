A pure annoyance sometimes and I find it best to just unscrew the cap and pour out the amount that I need.

It makes a good base for aromatherapy skin treatments, especially for dry skin. It also has a noticeable scent of it's own, a warm, sweet, almond aroma.The ingredients include: sunflower oil, rice bran oil, almond oil, apricot oil, avocado oil, wheat germ oil, Vitamin E, lecithin, Propylparaben and fragrance. Contains no mineral oil or artificial color. And since I prefer to mix my essential oils with one or two carrier oils, it is quite likely that I will not purchase this product again.
