Not only is the sitting position more comfortable than constantly kneeling, but when I'm done in one spot I just scoot along on the turtle and the wheels move smoothly and easily to the next.  It saves me a lot of time not having to hunt my gardening hand tools or getting them out of the shed-I just keep them inside the Lawn Buddy and they are always within easy access.  The cup holder is handy too-it holds a nice sized bottle of water.  I get my gardening done quickly and easily and it's also a great spot once I'm out in the pathways to just sit and enjoy the day.It's very sturdy.

It rained heavily all the next day and when I went out the day after, there was still water everywhere, but my tools stayed nice and dry.If it gets muddy or dirty it is easily cleaned inside and out-just use your spray nozzle on your garden hose and it cleans up nicely.

I am 73 years old and only five feet tall. My son got this for me years ago and there's not a day going by during spring, summer and fall that I'm not using it.  I sit on it to weed my gravel driveway and my perennial garden.  I move bags of mulch on it from my car to needed areas.  I have even put two concrete blocks on end into it to move from the garage to the front of my property.  When I bundle branches I place them across the top and pull the wonderful seat/handle to take them to the curb for trash pickup.  I can take a bag of trash to the curb, too. It is so much easier than a wheel barrow.  I can buy pots of flowers and move them from the car to the garden in my Lawn Buddy.  I fill big plant pots with humus from my compost pile to fill holes in the yard or to pot plants. If you have a friend or relative with a bad back get this for them and they will thank you forever.I had thought of getting a new Lawn Buddy and saw the Vertex. Even asked my son to get it for me cause I thought the help-up bar a good idea.  He bought it and after trying to use it I returned it.  I'm used to leaving my Lawn Buddy out in the rain.  If I did that with the Vertex the padded foam would take forever to dry.  The inside of the Vertex is fabric which drags on the ground and could only hold hand tools and I can't pick it up with two hands cause one side of the seat/lid doesn't latch onto anything.

It haul tools, plants, dirt, etc., not to mention an occasional baby, load of groceries, or my 2 Bichon Frise!  But it is BEST as a weeding tool.  It is low enough to weed comfortably, yet sturdy enough to boost myself back to standing, and small enough to get in amongst the plants.  I sit on the card and stuff the weeds into the lid/seat\'s handle hole. When the cart is full, I just pull it to the Yard Waste bin and dump it.  Caution: Try to remember to actually USE the tool tray.  I tend to forego it and I\'ve just been dumping my tools into the cart, often on top of my selection of weeding tools.  More than once, a helper has emptied the contents of one of my lawn buddys  into my yard waste tote without checking for hidden tools. I "lost" my expensive ratcheting pruners this summer. Shucks.  So use the tool tray!I have 3 Lawn Buddy\'s because I\'m a disabled gardener: upper level, lower level, backyard.  I sit on the cart and use my legs to scoot down the driveway, paths, and through the garden. When my oldest cart\'s back set of wheels broke, AMES immediately sent me out a replacement set, no charge.  The cart does have one design flaw, however.  The center of the body shell has a couple of plastic "tabs" that fit into matching indentations in the seat/lid: to hold it in place.  But if your weight shifts, particularly on hot days when the plastic is more malleable, these tabs break off.  Then, when you sit on the cart, the lid shifts over or starts of bend into the cart.  I have written AMES about this issue and they are looking into modifying the design for this spring\'s inventory.  We\'ll see, but I\'m hopeful!AMES stands behind their products, they have great customer service, and they LISTEN to their customer\'s suggestions.

It is useful for light-duty garden work, but don't expect it to carry a load of sand or gravel, or even a full bag of fertilizer or limestone, without breaking.  In fact, the item arrived, packed rather loosely in a large box, with one of the plastic axle-mounts broken off.  This was repairable with some good glue, but still....  The item should have been shipped upside down in the box to minimize such damage.  The design of the item and particularly the rather weak wheel-and-axle system keep this from earning a higher grade.  It is designed to be sat on, but I would be careful putting any faith in that aspect.", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Good garden cart for small chores', 'unixReviewTime': 1359504000, 'reviewTime': '01 30, 2013'}

I have early-onset arthritis in my knees, so I have to be careful not to put too much stress on them.  This cart has a sturdy seat at a comfortable height for me, and I like that it can also be used as a handle to pull the cart around.  I like the roomy storage inside and often leave some gardening tools there between uses.  The wheels roll smoothly as long as I don\'t try to use it after a hard rain.  I don\'t really use the drink holders, since they\'re not very deep and it would be easy to knock your drink over.  The entire cart is well-constructed and sturdy, without the flimsy appearance of some lower-priced carts.I found out it\'s not just for the outdoors, though, when I was removing three layers of wallpaper from my kitchen.  When I had to crouch or sit down near the baseboards, my knees hurt so much I could hardly walk afterward.  Fortunately, I remembered this cart, hosed it off and brought it inside.  It was the perfect height for working close to the floor, and allowed me to roll side to side without having to get up.  I also used it when painting the lower wall and trim, which made the job easier.I also put it to use when scrubbing the rims on my car.  Again, it was just the right height and let me roll from one wheel to another without having to get up.When my elderly mother started having trouble with her hips and knees, it made it hard to do housework or plant flowers.  I ordered this cart for her, and she loves it.  She calls it her "Cadillac," and enjoys rolling around doing what she needs to do.  She has also mentioned the sturdiness and lack of any sharp corners or edges.Although my cart is much older than hers, it still looks almost new and has held up very well.  My mom and I are both very pleased with this cart, and both of us would buy it again.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great for more than gardening', 'unixReviewTime': 1366934400, 'reviewTime': '04 26, 2013'}
