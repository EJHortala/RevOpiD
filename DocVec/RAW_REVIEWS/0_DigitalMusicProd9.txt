Grindle "Andre\' Grindle"', 'helpful': [3, 3], 'reviewText': 'During the mid 1950\'s the jazz genre was entering into a very different place. Not too long ago America\'s most popular music,it lost some of that public gained in the transition from swing to be-bop. There was brilliant music made. But not everyone wanted to hear it. With all the creative energy in the music splitting off in different directions after WW2,jazz wasn\'t just jazz anymore. There were all these new and different styles of the music:swing,be-bop,Dixieland,modal. And as time passed many many more. So it seemed any new musician who came along would be required to do something extremely daring and extremely original to "stay fresh". Coming straight from the be-bop era and playing with Miles Davis\'s early bands Sonny Rollins didn\'t seem incredibly worried about any of this. As a person whose interest in playing seemed to be more significant sometimes than his ego Sonny didn\'t seem as concerned on this album about any of that. Just about good playing.Perhaps it had something to do with Sonny\'s mild distrust of the recording studio belief that jazz came off more fully in live performance that one of the things that makes this album so interest is how much Sonny holds back from hogging major solo space. Also he\'s not a flamboyant improviser either. Of course this album is known by a lot of people by it\'s opener "St.Thomas",one of the most memorable melodies in jazz at the time with it\'s shuffling salsa rhythms and Sonny\'s clever invention of melody. "Strode Rode" is one of the few numbers on here where Sonny also solos a lot. On the final two numbers something very different happens. "Moritat" (more commonly known as "Mack The Knife") and at this time commonly associated with Louis Armstrong  has Rollins really only playing the melody while he pretty much lets Max Roach\'s flamboyant drum soloing and pianist Tommy Flanagan hold the floor the majority of the time. And why not? They are of course tremendous players. The same thing happens on the slower blues based numbers "You Don\'t Know What Love Is" and "Blue Seven".So in the end does this album open up any major new artistic territory for jazz?No it really doesn\'t. What it does do is find a quartet of some of jazz\'s most talented players of the time in Rollins,Flanagan,Max Roach and Doug Watkins on bass just doing basically the sort of musical set they might do while in performance. So in a way this could be seen more as an in the studio concert rather than a strictly studio based session. Of course almost all jazz at this time was recording this way with no overdubbing. And even though this is by no means a live album,something about the way the sound was captured really put a lot of emphasis on the the way Sonny Rollins presented his music. Sometimes a musicians approach to their sound,as opposed to the WAY they play is the most significant aspect of their talents. And I would have to say that about Sonny Rollins. He plays wonderfully,melodically and crisply with a great sense of bounce and swing to his sound as well. And that to me might be why this album is so beloved by so many jazz fans from all over.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Colossal Sonny Rollins!', 'unixReviewTime': 1331769600, 'reviewTime': '03 15, 2012'}

Frankly, I would have to say that is one of the more ridiculous things I've ever heard said about jazz.  Rollins is one of the great masters of jazz, on any insturment.  The only tenor player who I can clearly say is better than Rollins is Coltrane.Saxophone Colossus is the album that essentially made Rollins.  With Max Roach, Tommy Flanagan and Doug Watkins, this disc covers everything from the blues, to bop, to ballads, to carribean music.  They touch all the bases, and they touch them well.  'St. Thomas' is an incredible song which demonstrates Rollins almost unmatched ability to systematically develop a solo from the ground up.  Max Roach's drum solo is also fantastic.  'You Don't Know What Love Is' is probobly my favorite track.  Flanagan solo here is, in my opinion, his best on the record, possibly one of his best period.  'Strode Rode' is a hard-swingin' and kickin' track that shows off the quartet's ability to sit in the pocket and swing hard.  'Moritat' is my least favorite on the CD.  It's not bad my any means, it just doesn't speak to me in the way the other tracks do.  Finally, 'Blue 7' is the most simplistic, and in a way, brilliant track on the CD.  It's a pure, non-subsitution blues (in F i believe) that once again demonstrates perfectly Rollins ability to gradually build a solo.  He starts from the ground, and builds to a climax, then brings it back down again.  Also, Roach's 'melodic' drum solo is excellent here.In short, this is probobly one of the top 10 records in jazz.  For new listeners, its a must have, and a perfect introduction to jazz.  For 'veteran' listeners, and for students of the style, it provides perfect examples for structuring solos, and for making complexity our of simplicity.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Awesome', 'unixReviewTime': 1093824000, 'reviewTime': '08 30, 2004'}

This was a masterpiece by one of the most brilliant minded saxophonists in jazz.The genius had  recorded his seminal classic album, Tenor Madness, which is over-shadowed by this one, within the same couple of months, and Sonny was at the top of his game; until he quit for a time four years later.This album begins with one of the most famous and memorable jazz melodies ever. The song which later became Sonny's theme song, St. Thomas, which has been covered by many jazz artists such as Chuck Mangione and Mundell Lowe.The song is a brilliant composition and conversation between Sonny and drummer Max Roach. The song is begun in a latin rhythm set by Roach, in which Sonny does the melody and solos some of the most beautiful stuff my ears ever heard. Max Roach then takes then next solo still in the latin feel, then he sets the next groove by turning his snare on and begins to swing his solo until the whole rhythm section comes in for Sonny to express more of himself. Tommy Flanagan gets the next solo until Sonny goes back to the melody, (still swinging) for one verse, until Max sets the group back in the latin feel first demonstrated in the early minutes of the piece. This song is a classic.The only ballad here, You Don't Know What Love Is, is taken beautifully here. Strode Rode, an up-tempo piece swings heavily. The last bars of Flanagan's solo leading up to Sonny and Max's interchaning solos is haunting. Once the two do exchange solos, it is brilliant to listen to. Roach's never ending ideas with Sonny's unique play of the notes make Strode Rode a very enjoyable listen.The tune with the more popular title of Mack The Knife, (usually done by singer Bobby Darin) is in a more jazz setting here. And the masterpiece ends with Sonny's extraudinary composition, Blue seven. One highlight is Doug Watkins' bass line. Other highlights include Max's numerous drum solos.This album opened the door for many young players. It also gave Sonny the recognition he needed to be one of the most influential saxophonists in jazz.

He did not yet have the technique to express the wild ideas in his brain. A year later, however, he went to play with Thelonious Monk's quartet, and the experience liberated him and his style. Only at that point could he truly hold his own against Rollins, who was already a mature player by 1956.

It\'s distortion.  Shortly before the distortion there\'s a drop-out in the tape.  I checked this track on the Prestige Profiles Sonny Rollins release, and the distortion isn\'t present on that version.Bear in mind this album was recorded in 1956.  If you listen to these old jazz albums with high-quality headphones, you\'ll find the tapes have all sorts of flaws.  I was listening to a track on a Grant Green album that had some strange ping-pong dropouts, making me wonder if it would get through the song.  It did, but barely.How the tapes were stored is very important.  This remastering was done in 2006, 50 years after Rollins laid down the tracks.  I\'m not an LP enthusiast, but I think the original LP, mastered when the tapes were fresh, would sound better than digital mastering, regardless of the care that went into remastering.  Using original master tapes of older material might not always be the best decision in terms of sound quality.  The engineers should pick the best sounding tape of the track, not necessarily the master.  A later generation tape could sound better and be in better condition than the original master tapes.As far as the music is concerned, Rollins, Flanagan, Watkins, and Roach were masters of their art.  This is one of the most significant jazz recordings of the 1950s, and RVG did the best he could.  There\'s a reason collectors pay high prices for original LPs.

Rollins, who is far too different stylistically from Coltrane and Miles to compare, has been utterly successful at producing the most melodic and thematic jazz of its history.

Sonny rollins, aside from being a great saxophonist, was the kind of jazz musician who played the kind of jazz that people could really listen to. I don\'t mean Smooth, but understandable to a point where the average music fan, who likes all kinds, would listen to "Saxophone Collosus" and like it. Many mid to late sixties records from other labels like Impulse! or Bluenote were very obscure sounding and only few dedicated listeners could sit down and enjoy listening to them.Joining Rollins is the impeccable rhythmn section of Tommy Flanagan (piano), Doug Watkins (Bass) and Max roach (Drums). The Opener, "St Thomas", is a Rollins original and probably his most catchy sounding tune. He had previously been saxophonist in the Clifford Brown/Max Roach quintet where he and Roach developed a strong musical relationship, this may be some of their finest work together. "You don\'t know What love is" is a slow and very tasteful ballad, it has to be Sonny\'s best interpretation of a slower standard. Next is the upbeat "Strode rode" where Flanagan and Rollins get into the heavy groove. The latter 2 tracks are "Moritat" also known as "Mack the Knife", and "Blue seven" a medium groove blues. Both range over ten minutes long and provide plenty of solo space for everyone.This is an Essential, Classic, Masterpiece, with great bebop playing from Rollins and Co.

The five stars here are often abused too. So much albums are classified as "five stars" that you don\'t know how many stars you would need to make justice of this true masterpiece, of this true historical and essential album. This is something that could be rightly called "essential" and in the end a true "masterpiece" of the last century which has been so rich of true musical masterpieces by the way. In "Saxophone colossus" what you have it is simply the art of jazz at its highest level of expression. Sometimes history cristalized itself in a single moment, in a single event. "Saxophone colossus" is in my opinion the lucky perfect moment in which Jazz gave probably its overall best. It is the true zenith in Jazz. This happened right in that moment and in that place for some true clear reasons: this happened when the bop innovations have been completly acquired and explored, when free forms haven\'t already came to destroy the forms, where the third stream wasn\'t making it, it happened to a man who was a fantastic talent which has been lucky enough to work with all the best cats. It happens on the right label too (was not Blue Note). By the way it is still a fifties album, not a sixties one and this means a lot believe me. Some other players were equally important than Sonny Rollins (some other maybe even more, think of Bird), other albums has been more groundbreaking, other more courageous, other more creative (maybe) than "Saxophone Colossus" but this album is "Jazz". It is probably the most mature and complete Jazz album I know, the most flashing too, and I almost know them all. Some guys said here that Miles and Trane were bigger than Sonny. Sorry, I don\'t think so. In my opinion only Bird was bigger than Sonny and certainly not Miles neither Trane. Miles was a great charismatic figure, an inventive player, but only a decent trumpeter who didn\'t have the musicians quality Sonny had (noone who really knows Jazz can think different here). He didn\'t have a good technique he was not Navarro, Diz, Brownie, Morgan, Farmer on trumpet. Sonny was a technical master on saxophone, comparing them he was a better musician than Miles for sure. Trane was another historical figure for sure and he had chops impressive as Sonny\'s (or even bigger) but he tried too hard for what I am concerned to reach something new at the time and he did lose the sense of beauty, of balance in Jazz and the sense of "forms" (at least in his final period). And Trane didn\'t have the "irony" which is a tremendous quality for a musician. He was deadly serious, sometimes terribly boring. Sonny was funny, ironic, ... uncomparable. I love Trane of course, but Sonny is bigger than him for me. I don\'t remember a Trane album (and I own them all) beautiful as "Saxophone Colossus" so perfect in its forms, so clear in its intents, so creative inside the boundaries of the tradition but able to break them and to innovate too. So enjoyable, so delightful .. and I could go on forever! "Blue train" is great but its not equally perfect, enjoyable or funny. By the way Trane\'s "Blue train" it is surely another masterpiece but that\'s another story ..I love all the tunes here because they are really perfect in every sense, but if I have to point out one, my favourite tune would be "Strode rode". It is a fantastic minor speeder, Sonny outplay everyone in the biz here, he played some bop phrases which have killer logic, impressive timing, unbelievable melodical qualities, incredible strenghts. Obviously Sonny\'s rendition of "You don\'t know what love is" is equally superlative, a masterpiece in tenderness. It is a painting really. Noone played better that standard in the whole Jazz history, noone. Of course "St Thomas" is another perfect funny gem, like "Moritat" equally ironic and superlative.

After repeated listenings, however, I\'ve begun to question the basis for this seemingly universal high praise.Certainly, more than a few jazz critics rate the album very highly. For example, Joe Goldberg, in hisJazz Masters of the Fifties, states: "This LP, recorded with Roach, bassist Doug Watkins, and pianist Tommy Flanagan, is notable for two tracks, Moritat and Blue 7. With the latter piece, serious criticism of Rollins\' work began. In the first issue of the highly influential Jazz Review, Gunther Schuller called Blue 7 \'an example of a real variation technique. The improvisation is based not only on a harmonic sequence but on a melodic idea as well... what Sonny Rollins has added conclusively to the scope of jazz improvisation is the idea of developing and varying a main theme, and not just a secondary motive or phrase which the player happens to hit upon in the course of his improvisation and which in itself is unrelated to the \'head\' of the composition.\' "As for Moritat, Goldberg has nothing in particular to say. Personally, though, Mac the Knife is not one of my favorite older tunes and Rollins\' improvisations do not make the standard any more pleasurable for me. Additionally, Rollins\' bouncy, Carribbean-tinged tune, St Thomas, while light-hearted and with an infectious beat, wears rather thin upon repeated listenings.The masterwork on the album is indeed Blue 7, which I like a lot, but had jazz historian/composer Gunther Schuller not written his influential article, I suspect that it would remain among the many warmly appreciated but largely unheralded jazz compositions from the 1950s.Despite my personal idiosyncracies, still a highly recommended CD for fans of Sonny Rollins and fans of 1950s jazz.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Is This Really a Jazz Masterpiece?', 'unixReviewTime': 1303171200, 'reviewTime': '04 19, 2011'}

He is also one of the best and most important saxophone players of all time, along with John Coltrane and Charlie Parker. Anyone who has played saxophone has been somehow influenced by Sonny Rollins. The title of this landmark album, Saxophone Colossus, is a very suitable title. Rollins doesn't always get the credit he deserves, due to the fact that Coltrane came around soon after Rollins' success. Sonny Rollins, however, was and still is an incredibly important figure in jazz.Saxophone Colossus is the album that catapulted Sonny Rollins to this level. This was his first success and was a huge success. Saxophone Colossus remains one of the greatest and most important albums in jazz history. It is essential to every and any jazz fan. The music on this album is way ahead of its time. Recorded only in 1956, this album sounds like it was recorded in the mid sixties. It is incredible that Rollins made this album before hearing some of John Coltrane's and Miles Davis' albums of the early and mid sixties.One of the reasons why this album came out so well is due to the great band. This incredible quartet had Sonny Rollins on tenor sax, Doug Watkins on bass, Tommy Flanagan on piano, and legendary drummer Max Roach. In fact, Rollins sax is the only brass instrument on the album. With the other three musicians working as an incredible rhythm section complimenting Rollins playing, you have nothing else to do but to sit in marvel at his playing.Besides having a great band, the five songs on this album are all incredible. St. Thomas is the obvious highlight, and has know ecome a jazz standard. You Don't Know Waht Love Is serves as the ballad of the album, and an incredible one at that. Strode Rode is another brilliant song, as is Moritat, which later served as the basis for Mack The Knife. The final song, Blue 7, is amzing, easily one of the best on the album.Not only is this an essential album to listen to, but I guarantee that you will listen to it over and over again.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Album That Made Rollins A Legend', 'unixReviewTime': 986688000, 'reviewTime': '04 8, 2001'}

It not only helps you develop your own sound, but also trains your ears to the nuances of jazz. This album is chock full of great tunes to transcribe. St. Thomas, Strode Rode and Blue 7 all are classics in their own right. If you don't want to transcribe, just get it to internalize his sound. He is incredibly lyrical and never loses sight of the head of the tune. Plus there are some of my favorite licks in Strode Rode. This album is also a great place to transcribe becauseThe Best Of Sonny Rollins (Artist Transcriptions)contains almost all the tunes from this album. So you can see how close you were in your transcription. One parting word. The easiest way to get better at jazz is to listen to it.Now, for the listeners: This album provides a great entrance into the 1950's small combo jazz scene. Not only is this album regarded as one of the greatest from this time period (great line up, good tunes), but it is pretty easy to get your head around (but enough here to keep you coming back for years). Let me clarify. In St. Thomas, you can hear what Sonny Rollins is trying to do (periodically echo the head of the tune) and Max roach does the same. This album helped me appreciate drummers (never had before I heard Max Roach on this album). Additionally, Blue 7 is a great tune to learn about jazz. The tune has a 'mysterious feel', especially when it is compared to other blues tunes (not sure how else to say it). This is because it is difficult to tell if Sonny is playing this blues in C or F# (tenor sax tuning). The reason this is important is the 3rd and the 7th are shared between these two keys. While the bass player is playing in the key of C, Sonny is (kind of) playing with both the keys of C and F#, creating and releasing tension. Comparing this blues tune to other blues tunes can help you hear what artists are trying to do. This really opened up the world of jazz for me. It moved from just a bunch of notes to something so much more.Overall, this is one of my favorite jazz albums of all time. Get it. Read about it.

An opening like that would perhaps lead one to expect a playful record. But what is to come is no mere light-hearted experiment in festivity. Rollins explores territories in which improvisation and composition become indistinguishable.A now famous analysis by Gunther Schuller of "Blue 7" described Rollins\' development of the solo as "thematic": the construction of the solo was derived from elaborate phrasing, building towards greater complexity until final resolution, like a formal composition. Weil and Brecht\'s "Moritat" (a.k.a. "Mack the Knife") gets an astonishing reading, but the peak of the album\'s intensity might be the dialogue between Rollins and Max Roach on "Strode Rode".

Granted, Sonny belongs in that special group of seminal giants--Hawk, Ben, and Prez and then come Stan, Stitt, Rollins, and a fellow by the name of Coltrane.  Moreover, attentive listeners will discover equally impressive, gifted, expressive tenor players if they listen carefully to scandalously neglected musicians like Harold Land and Hank Mobley.But age, apparently, has its privileges, and Sonny has been making records for 62 years, which in itself deserves some kind of special mention (though so has James Moody, and certainly Jimmy Heath isn\'t far behind).  Moreover, "Colossus," which Amazon currently lists as its best-selling Rollins\' date, was recorded in 1956, rather early for a player venerated for his "seminal" influence on the music.Sonny\'s sound, at least to my ears, changed dramatically around 1970.  Apparently a number of listeners prefer his earlier, darker, deeper, more muscular sound--at least based on the durability of his most revered sessions--most of them from the \'50s.  "Newk\'s Time," "Way Out West," "Freedom Now Suite," "Vol. 2," "Tenor Madness," "The Bridge"--these are the early Rollin\' sessions that stand out, more so than the later ones, which featured a tenor sound that was more treblish, penetrating, rough and ragged (Sonny deserves credit for keeping his chops in shape, far more than other tenor greats)."Saxophone Colossus" may be the ideal place to start, a second stop might be "Tenor Madness" (the sound of Coltrane should expain, in part, Rollins\' decision to take a 3-year sabbatical from the music), and then it may be time for some of the numerous trio recordings (which require a more devoted student of the tenor, someone not requiring the moderating sound of a piano)."St. Thomas" remains Rollins\' best-known composition, and "Blue 7" one of the best examples of his "motivic" approach to improvisation.  And it should not go unnoticed that the pianist on "Colossus"--Tommy Flanagan--was also the pianist on Coltrane\'s arguably most influential recording: "Giant Steps."  Finally, Sonny (or few other musicians) never had a better bass player than Doug Watkins.

I just picked it up at the store one day because one of my friends was raving about how awesome of a sax player he was and also because I read that he was a big influence to one of my favorite saxophonists, John Coltrane.  When I heard the first note from Sonny's sax I noticed something that I've never heard in any other sax's tone.  I heard a real controlled rich sound that was truly brilliant.  St. Thomas written by Sonny has a bit of a latin touch to it.  Max Roach first lays out the beat then comes Sonny blowing down the head.  Sonny's solo is just awesome with those octave jumps.  Moritat is a very familiar tune but under a different name, you'll know what I mean when you hear it.  To me there are two tracks that really stand out above the rest, Strode Rode and St. Thomas. On the swinging starts and stops of &quot;Strode Rode&quot; and the dreamy blues cycles of &quot;Blue 7,&quot; Rollins began his solos with simple melodic motifs, and orchestrated them into grand, elongated thematic statements--every note made meaningful by Rollins' extraordinary sense of development and intuitive musical architecture.

I agree with those who believe that Sonny is the greatest improviser of the last 50 years, or more.  Every cut on Saxophone Colossus is a jewel.  Blue 7 was famously analyzed by musicologist Gunther Schuller as a model of almost architectural structure in improvised music.  I prefer to think of it as melodic storytelling.

Roach's drumming seems very inventive here, and this recording is living proof that modern-day drum machines and rhythm sampling dramatically shortchange the listener. Finally, I know that many listeners who would like to get into Sonny's work are usually directed to this recording first. Not a bad recommendation, but in my opinion, his 1990 recording &quot;Falling in Love with Jazz&quot; will make you do exactly what the title suggests.

I guess I really just always digged his rough, deep sound and his endless array of ideas.  Being that he is my favorite tenor player, "Saxophone Colossus" has always been one of my favorite albums ever since the first time I heard it.  This group (Sonny, the superb Tommy Flanagan,Doug Watkins on bass, and the incredible Max Roach on drums)  works so well together, I really feel that they should\'ve become a working group or at least have recorded one more time together.  Every single track has a different style but are all equally compelling.  "St. Thomas" , without a doubt the famous composition on this album and probably that Sonny ever did, is truly one of the catchiest themes in existence.  Sonny\'s solo on this cut is truly a classic now and is essential listening for all jazz saxophonists to listen to how to handle a latin tune such as this.  Tommy Flanagan and Max Roach also have extended, very impressive solos which are some of the best I\'ve ever heard them do.  "You Don\'t Know What Love Is" is a beautiful ballad that became much more popular as a result of this recording.  Sonny\'s solo, although humorous, has a certain sadness to it.  The somewhat gentle mood is continued greatly in Flanagan\'s solo and the track concludes in a very emotional finale.  "Strode Rode" swings extremely hard and shows all present at their very best.  "Moritat" (more commonly known as "Mack the Knife") is a very popular show tune that you are probably familiar with even if you haven\'t heard this cd.  Of all the many versions done of this tune, Sonny\'s is by far the best.  The album then concludes with "Blue 7", which is the most influential composition on this cd due to the fact that it single-handedly introduced the concept of thematic improvisation.  All four members of the ensemble provide nice, laid-back, dreamy solos that brings the album to a quiet close.  If you don\'t already own this cd, you probably feel that this cd could never possibly live up to all the hype.  This is one of the rare cases where every good thing said about this awesome cd is completely justified.

Very powerful, which is great in a Big Band, but not fitting in the post Big Band Era.  On the other hand, if you listen to a few earlier Rollins albums from the early fifties, when Art Blakey accompanied him, you will see how Blakey always knew what to play with whomever he was playing. He was extremely versatile thoughout his career. Max Roach, on the other hand, in my opinion, was GREAT, but always played the same way. In the case of Post Big Band Jazz, he just didn't seem to play what was fitting. Always too hard and always too much whenever the bass player was doing his solo.
