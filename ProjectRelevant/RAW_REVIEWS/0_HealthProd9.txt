Teshin "miracle of science"', 'helpful': [13, 15], 'reviewText': "I first learned of BFI Powder years ago after visiting a cousin in Australia. She gave me a small container to use and keep after I cut myself. I was hoping for some nice anti-biotic cream, but instead got this powder, which for the life of me I thought would never stay on the wound. I took the container but did not use it at that time. Okay, now cut to many many years later...I was a diabetic and started have serious problems with open wounds on my feet. The podiatrists I was seeing tried everything they knew to heal what were basically holes on my heels. They gave me a powder that was supposed to stimulate skin growth. It didn't work, but after running out of it on a weekend, I saw the BFI powder in my medicine cabinet, that had been gathering dust since my trip to Australia. I used it for a bit over a week, and when I next saw my doctor, he was amazed that my wounds looked like they had almost healed! After I ran out of the powder, I started searching for it on the internet and finally found some for sale at a pet supply company (used on dogs ears after they are cropped) for crying out loud! Needless to say, from that point on, I was a convert, and still use it for any wound problems I have with my feet. Thankfully, it is now available on many web sites. I make sure I always have a container or two at home, because like magical fairy dust it really works when other remedies fail.", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Magical Fairy Dust', 'unixReviewTime': 1123286400, 'reviewTime': '08 6, 2005'}
