However, I'd like to KEEP my skin looking youthful, and I know that I do get some sun exposure just from doing everyday things like walking the dog or driving to work.  Also, several older relatives (70s and 80s) have had a basal cell skin cancer on their faces.  I figure if I start working on prevention NOW, when I reach that age, I'll be less likely to develop the same problem.Furthermore, I've been using some rather harsh salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide treatments lately, and these are drying to my skin.  Ideally, I wanted a moisturizer with some sun protection that could also help keep my skin from drying out.  This moisturizer was a quick (i.e., without any research), off-the-shelf purchase at a local drugstore.  I have not used any Olay products in the past.This product seems to be doing an excellent job, so far.  While I can't predict what will happen in 5 or 10 years, I'm very happy with the day-to-day benefits of using this moisturizer.  I put this on in the morning before going to work and wash my face again about 10 hours later.  During that time, my face does not look oily at all.  Further, I have sensitive skin and I don't notice any redness or irritation.  Also, this product does not have a fragrance to it (fragrances are particularly irritating to my skin).  So it truly is good for MY sensitive skin.One problem I have often had in the past due to dry skin is that when I dye my hair, the dye gets sucked into my skin and leaves purple stains on my forehead (I have a pale complexion and I dye my hair black).  I end up looking ridiculous for a couple of days.  I've had one hair appointment so far since I started using this moisturizer, and my skin is much less dry -- few to no purple stains on my forehead this time!I also think my skin is pretty soft since I've been using this, and I have not had any additional or unusual breakouts (the package says it is non-comedogenic), so that's nice, as well.  For what it's worth, it's easy to put on makeup (i.e., foundation) after applying this moisturizer.  Finally, you should know that a little goes a long way -- it really does not take much to get full coverage of your face; I expect the bottle to last a long time.Wow, I don't normally gush about skincare products this much.  I guess this is one of those rare cases when I really can't think of anything I don't like about the product.
