It\'s a you-either-love-it-or-you-don\'t game. The game reeks of repetition, but it just has that charm that keeps certain people coming at it over and over. I suppose what really determines which of the two aforementioned categories is how good you are at it. I mean, if you really suck at it, like me, you would spend all day trying to water your plants, and have no time with any interaction, which is the true heart and soul behind this game. Sure, growing crops, raising animals, and foraging are important, but if that\'s all you do, you\'re not experiencing this game to its fullest.Harvest Moon 64 was perhaps the Nintendo 64 game with the largest amount of possible character interaction until Nintendo released Animal Forest in late 2001. There are *counts* *gives up* over 30 people in that little town, and you can speak to all of them. Some of the people are not very fun to talk to, but others provide you with some hearty conversations and long-lasting friendships, especially the five available ladies. Oh yeah. My favorites are Anne and Elli. Ahem...although Harvest Moon 64 has that dating sim aspect, the actual process of winning their hearts is a bit confusing. Perhaps I just don\'t understand it. Other activities fill the year, such as festivals and horse/dog races. They break the monotony and offer some welcomed changes to the gameplay. Of course, you can add to the monotony during the races by spending time betting max coins for each entry, but I guess that\'s your choice. The gameplay here is pretty open-ended. It\'s just that the days pass so fast. Even though your character looks like he should be in middle school, it is possible for you to start a family. It\'s too bad your son will always stay a mooch. While the monotonous gameplay would seem soporific give it a try anyways. If you\'re good, then you\'d most likely enjoy this game. Not only that, it would also be fun to watch. That\'s right. It is in fact FUN to watch somebody that is good.The graphics are nothing special. The entire game is played from a top-down perspective, and your character\'s movement is a bit...odd, to say the least. Because the action is seen from the angle, moving in diagnals is the way to go. The character models are actually not that bad. They have this cute, beady-eyed look that is quite adorable. The music is very nice, but it is too short and as a result loops too often. Some people faulted the game for talking only in text. But you know what? Voice acting would have ruined it. Oh yeah. This is probably the only N64 with the descriptor "Alcohol Use".', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Hopelessly addicting', 'unixReviewTime': 1103241600, 'reviewTime': '12 17, 2004'}

As the months go by, you participate in different holidays and contests, hopefully getting livestock, chickens, expansions to your house, and hopefully getting a wife.  As the years go by, you get richer and richer, and there become more menial chores, milking and feeding the cows, watering and picking the plants, feeding the chickens, and cutting the grass, which leave you with most of the day, but it takes quite a bit of real time to accomplish.

And by the way, the Mayor is absolutely the most lovable character ever!I liked how there was always something to do, the pacing was just right so time didn\'t pass too fast or too slow, there was always new things happening around town (festivals, etc) and no day was the same rain, snow, maybe there would be a tornado, maybe someone would greet you at the front door and travel to the mountains with you, etc.The closest game I\'ve played is Harvest Moon: Tree of Tranquility for Wii for anyone whos interested, but that one also has some faults.Overall if you haven\'t played this you are definitely missing out, and if you have played from this series before, you should try this one because it is a different and great game on its own, that still stands up to some of the "free-roam" do anything types of games that exist today.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Amazing Game', 'unixReviewTime': 1306022400, 'reviewTime': '05 22, 2011'}

After getting permission from you dad to take over his farm, you will wake up to your first day.POINT OF THE GAME = To try and have the most complete game possible.To have the "perfect" game you will need to get all these things before your 3rd year at the farm:1. You will need to buy and take care of lots of animals on your farm. You can raise cows, sheep, and chickens.2. You will need to grow crops of different kinds. You can grow: Tomatoes, corn, potatoes, turnips, cabbage, eggplants, and strawberries. ... You will also need to grow lots of grass and flowers.3. Do a lot of fishing. You can fish at the river, lake, or ocean.4. Make friends with ALL the villagers by giving them gifts and going to all the festivals.5. Win over your favorite girl, marry her, and have a child. There are 5 eligible girls you can marry.6. Have all the home extensions and add-ons. The Kitchen, bathroom, baby bed, cabinets, ect...7. Gather all of the recipes the villagers will give you.8. Have all the pictures in your photo album that are taken at different events or festivals.9. Make sure your horse and dog win the races and get gold metals.10. Have all 10 "power berries". (They give you more stamina during the day.)If you can manage to do everything listed above and more, when your dad comes by on Summer of your 3rd year, he will hold a party at your house and you will get the legendary "party picture".

Have you wanted to just create a duel life where you have a nice little family? Harvest Moon 64 does this by combining the elements of farming and dating, to bring you one of the most spectacular simulation video games ever.Story 9/10: As the game starts out, you learn that your grandfather has passed away, and you have inherited his farm. Each day you go outside and tend to your farm. (Pulling weeds, planting stuff, etc.) Along the way you can participate in fun town activities/festivals, and if you get bored you can go to the bar, take a shower, or tend to your animals! You also have 5 girls to choose to date/marry (Ann, Elli, Karen, Maria, and Popuri.Gameplay 10/10- Probably the best simulation/RPG on the N64. Anyone can love this game, even if they hate farming. The difficulty can also range, depending on whether or not you want to get EVERYTHING in the game. You could choose to work your tail off everyday, or just lay back and enjoy life.Sound 8/10- The tunes are pretty good, and they each fit they're season/location. However, after a while the music can get a little repetitive.Graphics 8/10- The Graphics aren't that great, but they are very good compared to the previous Harvest Moon games. The characters aren't too blocky and the scenery/landscape is pretty good as well. This is the first 3D game in the series.Replay 10/10- You won't want to put this game down for a LONG time. Even after you beat the game, you will probably feel the urge to keep playing (even though it goes on forever). Or you could decide to create a new file and try new things (Marry a different girl, make more friends, get a better score, etc.).Overall 9.5/10- There is always some sort of repetitiveness in a simulation game, but Harvest Moon 64 turns that negative aspect into a positive one.

The music can get annoying with all of the starting and stopping that it does, but that can be fixed by simply turning the sound down.2.

When I first saw this game at a friend\'s house, I couldn\'t believe someone would waste their money on what seemed like such a stupid game. Finally, my buddy got me to play it. I was hooked. This game is probably more addicting than even the hardest of drugs. It may seem silly to just want to play a game that you seem to do the same thing on a daily basis. At first, that really is all you do in the game. As you play it more, you start to discover that there is so much more to it. I wouldn\'t call it a "life simulator", but it is actually a very good game for teaching little lessons. It makes you REALLY micromanage your time. Due to how short the days are, you can\'t really sit there and piddle away your time, or you will be out of time. There are so many little activities you can do in the game, too. If you want to ONLY work with crops and play the bare minimum of the game structure, you can do so. If you do, you are severely limiting the game, though. If you want to raise animals, you can. Don\'t forget to feed them, though. If you keep forgetting, they will die.At certain times in the year, there are little festivals you can go to, as well as competitions you can compete in. There are horse races, dog races, a swimming race, an "easter egg" hunt, vegetable competition, and other things. In the winter, you can\'t grow any crops outside. Your only option is if you have built the greenhouse. Having the greenhouse allows you to grow any crop at any time of the year. If you don\'t have it, the mine opens for a certain amount of time, and you can use that to attempt to make money.Aside from those big parts of the game, you can also try to make one of the several girls in the game fall for you. To me, it was always Karen that I went after. How you make them grow fond of you varies for each one. If you take too long, though, you won\'t have to worry about any of them. You will be all alone. Forever. They will each get married to someone else or run off.When you are playing, you can try to play it to make yourself rich, or you can just try to have the most fun possible, or both. I have played a number of games. I literally played my N64 until the thing finally wore out. After it did, I was pretty sad. I wasn\'t so upset about being unable to play my other games. It was this game that took up probably 95% of all my time with the N64. However, I still play this game to this very day on an emulator. I STILL cannot get enough of it. It is by far the best game I have EVER owned. If someone were to clone this game with a possible update to the graphics(though they should leave the option to play with the old style graphics, too!) and release it for the current generation of consoles, they wouldn\'t be able to take the money out of my hand fast enough when it comes to this game. I would still gladly pay $60 for a new copy of it.I have spent WAY too many hours of my life on this game, and I look forward to spending many more of them on it, too. It isn\'t every day you find a game that virtually lacks violence, foul language, and all those things, yet is still so entertaining that it just keeps you coming back for more. This game does that.

When I read the words &quot;farm&quot; and &quot;cow&quot; I knew this was the game for me.  I all truthfulness, most people glance at the cover of this game and pass it by, hoping for something more action-packed and bloody and gruesome. But even if you ARE one of those people looking for a thrilling adventure, you're going to get it in Harvest Moon.The story is this: your grandfather dies, leaving you his pathetic, decrepit little farm on the coast, along with the dog.  You get to name the dog.  You also get to clear away the entire field, which is covered in weeds, stumps and rocks.  This is the only boring part in the game. But some prefer to skip this tedious work, and go directly to the nextdoor ranch, where you will pick up your sweet little baby horse for free.  there you will meet ann, the rancher's daughter.  she's a nice gal.Over all, you get to care for your horse, your dog, your crops, buy chickens, sheep and cows, and care for them too.  It's genuinely fun, because so many things can happen, depending on what you do.  If you give the bartender some food, he'll give you a bottle of wine.  then if you feed the sprites mushrooms, they'll tell you to go to the goddess pond in the mountains.  the goddess will suggest you restore the Vineyard.  It is one fun thing after another.I apologize for the length of this review, but I assure you, you will not be bored by this wonderful game.  It's farming on a whole new level.

But Harvest Moon 64 is the most addictively entertaining game I have ever played, and I don't usually like RPGs.You play a young man whose grandfather has died and left him his run-down farm to revive. There are tons of chores to do, animals to raise, vegetables to harvest, people to visit, girls to marry, Spring Festivals, Horse Races, swimming contests and much much more. There's always money to make and things to buy that can improve your house, farm or love life.After 3 years, the man's parents come to rate how he's done, depending on how well the farm is doing. There are 4 seasons, each consisting of 30 days. There are 120 days in a Harvest Moon year, and around 5 minutes in each day. As the seasons change the events, vegetables, scenery and people's dialogues change as well. There are new events every year.One thing that is pretty amazing is that this game is entirely free of violence, blood, or action, yet it's fun for all ages. It's good for kids because it is peaceful and non-violent, and makes them use strategy and helps them calculate time. It's good for older people too because it is challenging and there are many surprises to keep you coming back for more. This game has a very high replay value, because each time you play it it is completely different (you can marry 5 different girls, and depending on which one you persue, the game changes a lot).

I can only hope that Harvest Moon 3 GBC is one minute= 1 hour.Dont get me wrong, I like this version the best.  They made it simpler than the versions before it, and made it more about social life.

While you are required to play a man in Harvest Moon 64, flirting with village girls in hope of marriage to one of them, you might find that a little strange. Still, this game is fascinating. You have to care for cows, sheep, and chickens, own a horse and a dog, grow crops and grass (fodder for your animals), purchase items to benefit your farm, expand your home, chop wood, break up stones, weed the garden, power-up your tools...and when you're done, you get to do it all again the next day! Plus, there are special activities. You can marry a girl in the village, start a family with a baby of your own, register your dog and horse in local races, attend village festivals, vote for the annual Harvest Goddess (will it be your sweetheart?), and befriend over 50 silly characters in this game. I have to say that my favorite is the Gourmet chef who comes to festivals to be a taste judge of milk and vegetables (depending on the festival itself). He says, &quot;Mmmm...

I admit to having my own doubts  about spending money on a game that had the sole objective of raising a  successful farm/family.  But, once you get past the silly apprehensions,  you'll find that Harvest Moon is one of the best (and most original) RPGs  for N64 out there (second only to Zelda).The basic storyline (i.e.  your character inherits a rather poor farm) has been explained in previous  reviews, so I won't devote much time to describing the various actions  required of your character.  Taken at face value, the graphics are cutesy  and well-done, the controls are smooth, and the play is easy to follow.  This is one of those rare games that you can complete over and over again  with minimal boredom, as each game promises different results based on your  actions.  And there is always room for improvement; my first attempt at  farming was pretty poor/unsuccessful, but I've significantly improved over  time.  Another benefit of the game is that it's universal, as far as age  goes.  Little kids can enjoy it as much as ze older folk.My only  complaints are trivial and do not take away from the overall quality of the  game:  The English is pretty choppy and slightly off, and sometimes the  character interactions are a bit too gratuitous and drawn-out.

In Harvest Moon 64, you play as a guy who gets to run a farm and have a personal life.The method of farming in this game is completely done by your character; you till the land, plant the seeds, and water them until plants grow.  And you have to do everything in 2 minutes and 45 seconds because you wake up at 6:00 a.m., hours in this game are 15 seconds long, and the person that picks up the crops comes at 5:00 p.m..  However, time does not pass while you are in buildings.  If you do to much without eating or sleeping (sleeping brings you to the next day), you will not be able to use tools.Compared to the Harvest Moon for the Super Nintendo, this game has a good number of new features:1) Tools power-up with the amount of times they are used, as apposed to completing a certain event in the game that gives you a stronger tool.2) You have to buy your groceries (the food you automatically eat when you wake up and at noon).3) You can raise sheep!  The money comes from their wool.4) There are new competitions that include racing your dog or horse.I could go on and on about the new aspects of HM64.However, in HM64, there is a lot of misparagraphed text and there are also some bugs in the game.  One bug in particular that I have found is that at some point in the game, Elle\'s grandmother may die if you talk to her, usually during spring.  Make sure this never happens on a day when something is happening (New Years, etc.) or your game will freeze.Even with the bugs (try to avoid them!!!), this game still stands out as a great "real life" video game.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Celebrate the coming of the Harvest Moon!!!', 'unixReviewTime': 1050278400, 'reviewTime': '04 14, 2003'}

But honestly? I prefer this over the modern and oh so cute new animation. Also, for someone who is experienced with Harvest Moon, this game can end up being very easy. Especially, near the end of the second and third year. Being someone who grew up playing Friends of Mineral Town, I mastered this game! For my last complaint, the controls can be annoying. Just wait to you try to ship all of your crops...going back in and out of your bag...As for the positives, there are a lot. The majority of the characters in this game are actually FLESHED OUT. I feel like the cutscenes and heart events were not written for children. It is actually interesting and heartwarming, something I miss about Harvest Moon nowadays. The festivals are interesting and fun, something to look forward to all throughout the months!The farming system? Perfection! So simple and easy to understand. I absolutely adore the greenhouse you can purchase and I love the fast past feel. You can accomplish little things around the farm each day, little by little. That's the way I like it.In conclusion, I adore this game! It works as a perfect introduction for the series. The characters and town have really stayed with me.

You start out on a dead farm with nothing but weak tools and 300G, but eventually you will get horses and cows, sheep and chicken by just planting crops, you can get sick, your animals will if you don't feed them, they will die, you won't, your sweety will give you medicine if you are sick, if you don't have one you will just stay in bed all day, no one visiting. You will need to treat the animals or they will die. You get married by one of 5 possible candidates named Ann, Maria, Popouri, Karen, and Elli. Ann Is an orange haired girl in a barn with her brother and father, loves animals, will marry a boy named cliff if you are friends with both. Maria is a shy librarian who lives with her mother and father (the mayor is her father) she loves cabbage, marries mailman, like Ann with cliff. Popuri lives with her mum and pa in a flower shop, her father isn't in the Ville most of the year, loves flowers, will marry Ann's brother (Odd couple, a happy girl with a man who's tank is empty on social skills). Karen is beautiful face with a negative disposition toward her father, like a snot nosed punk, but they love each other once you get to know them both, she lives with father, mother, and a foreign boy at a vineyard, easiest to marry, just show her your dog over and over, will marry foreign guy, but might leave if your not nice to her, same with foreign man and cliff. Elli owns a bakery with her grandma, who dies eventually, and a man whom you THINK is the father, but like other brides, will marry him if you don't marry her, she likes milk and eggs to make her cakes, cookies, and pies. Now, I heard that the mayor can be you bride err...husband, I am not sure of that though. Well after you marry, if you are extremely nice to your wife (go to sleep at the same time as her, give her gifts each day, especially on her birthday [can't remember by heart] and don't flirt with other girls) then you can have a baby. The other couples can have a baby too. Order and sell animals and animal products to and from Ann's father, buy seeds from Popouri's mother, sell crops to a guy who looks like he lifts a lot of weights, milk, eggs, and wool too, add attachments to your farm by buying them from the carpenters. Get married by making the heart at the bottom red for the girls, buy a baby crib, and then buying a blue feather and presenting it to the fine young lady of your choice, if they accept, you are officially engaged and get married on the next Sunday. The blue feather doesn't appear until you have a red hearty and a baby crib, and I think a kitchen too. You can befriend anyone in town, even tourists, events happen, it's a real-life-farming-game. that is the basic layout of the game, an even easier layout to understand is, get rich, have a family and have friends.
