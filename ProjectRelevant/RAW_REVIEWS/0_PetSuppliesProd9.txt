After 6 weeks on this food, she developed pancreatitis. This was in my non-diabetic cat. She had nothing else wrong with her, but pancreatitits. I was told that a high-fat diet can cause pancreatitis. After doing some research, I discovered that 58% of the calories in this food come from fat. It has a higher fat percentage than most grocery store cat foods! Is it a coincidence that my cat got pancreatitis after eating this food? Maybe. But she has never had it before. After barely eating for 2 weeks, hiding, not her usual self, and fearing that she would have to be hospitalized if she stopped eating entirely, I have decided to switch her to a lower fat food. I am unsure if I will continue to feed this to my diabetic cat.**I recently decided to switch my diabetic cat to this food from Purina DM canned food. The problem that I was having was that my diabetic cat would get into my other cat's food (Friskies). Also, I wanted to switch my other kitty to a healthier canned food. This product seemed more affordable than other high quality canned foods. I checked the fat/carb/protein content and discovered that it is almost identical to Purina DM. The carb content is slightly higher in the Wellness. If you have a diabetic cat, be sure you talk with your vet about your cat's insulin dosing before you make the switch to another food. My vet approved of this food for both my cats, suggesting that it is better nutritionally than both Friskies and even the DM.Both cats are thriving on this cat. My other cat who had lost weight due to a stressful move quickly regained the weight she had lost. And my diabetic cat is like a kitten again! She has become so much more high-energy and is really enjoying her play time more than she used to.

Cats, as obligate carnivores, don't need grain, and in fact--if you give them something with a lot of carbs, they will continue eating until they have enough protein.Since I switched my cats a few years back to this brand, both lost weight even though I feed them as much of this as they will eat. It completely transformed one of my cats. He was dumpy, overweight and middle-aged and since the food transition he lost weight and has become more active. His fur looks amazing! I also recommended this food to a friend, forgot I made the recommendation and six months later was over his house and said, wow, your cat looks amazing! He said, yeah, it's the food change we talked about.That said, the Wellness line is not my cat's favorite by any means. The reason is that it's like switching a person from potato chips and McDonald's to good healthy food. The supermarket brands such as Fancy Feast are filled with rendered fat, which smells great and makes cats go crazy. This has none of this, so they miss it. I transitioned VERY slowly, mixing the food they liked with a small amount of this and gradually increasing the proportion over months.Now, years later, my cat eats this with gusto--though, of course, if I brought Fancy Feast back he would go nuts again for that, but I don't. This is is his second favorite flavor after this one:Wellness Canned Cat Food, Chicken and Herring Recipe, 12-Pack of 12-1/2-Ounce Cans.The nice thing about this food is that, while he now eats it with apparent pleasure, my cat never overeats. I can give him as much as he wants/asks for and he stays the same weight. I'd say he eats an average of a half 12-ounce can a day, but it varies--some days he eats almost a full can, other days less than half. So essentially he self regulates, whereas with the kitty crack and dried food, full of grain, he overate.These large cans must be opened with a can opener. I buy them because they are a better value economically--the small cans of this brand are way expensive. Even this is expensive per ounce,, but if you actually do a calculation of dollars paid per protein this one stacks up just fine to the less expensive brands.  Which means my cat gets the nutrition he needs in fewer ounces.

I used to feed her Purina One dry food, but after a ton of research and questions, I\'m slowly figuring out what she really needs to thrive. Wellness uses human-grade ingredients, and while I don\'t care for the Guar Gum or Carageenan additives, it\'s still a product worth buying.With regards to the one star rating, shame on you for buying from a breeder, and for passing up "health food" for your pets. Just because they can survive on cheap food that doesn\'t use natural ingredients, doesn\'t mean it\'s good for them. Children can survive on a diet of sugar cereal and cheeseburgers, but no responsible parent would feed that to them, either. If you love your kids, you make them eat their vegetables.In conclusion, it may take a little while for your kitty to accept natural food that isn\'t filled with nasty additives and flavorings to make it stinky, but when they do you will see an improvement!

There are 24 cans at 3 oz. each.  That's all I can really say objectively about cat food.Subjectively speaking...I could not believe the difference in my cats after switching to a canned cat food from dry food.  My cats are 15 and 16 years old.  They are healthy indoor cats who are still active and playful with no real health problems aside from my 16 year old cat having minor diabetes.  I had been feeding a high priced prescription (vet recommended) dry food for the last 2 years only to have my 15 year old cat begin getting sick and regurgitating his food on a weekly basis.  I took my cat to the vet repeatedly asking why this might be a problem.  The vet simply told me that the cat may be a little under the weather or it was hairball related...which before had not been an issue.  After a conversation with a friend in Dec 2010 they emphatically recommended canned cat food.  I decided to do some research and was I glad that I did.  My cats have been eating canned food for 2 months now and here are the changes I've noticed.  My cat who was throwing up 2-4 times a week has only done so 4 times in 2 months (and I think that was because he was biting at some straw that I didn't know about), their fur is ridiculously softer...like I just spent an hour brushing them, now it feels that way all the time.  And although my cats are not prone to hairballs, my medium haired cat would get them on occasion and he has had only 1 very small one in 2 months as opposed to the weekly ones I'd find in the house.  They have more energy and they just seem happier in how they interact and the littler box has less to be cleaned up and quite frankly it smells less offensive than it did before.  Don't get me wrong...cat boxes smell but I've been told (and now I feel I can attest to this) that dry food would dehydrate a cat and it would enter a system and absorb odors from the body and carry them out into the cat box to amplify the foul odors.  Actual cat food like the Wellness brand (not many brands are grain or rice free)  gets more fully digested by the cat and does not contain grains and rices and other fillers that are expelled with the body.  I must say that I felt the fool not having taken more time to learn about the diet possibilities of my cats.I will note that I also use the Wellness dry food (about 1/4 to 1/2 cup out each night) for my 2 cats to eat between their canned meals.  This is also to keep them used to eating a little dry food in case I am in a situation where I cannot provide their can in the morning and night.  For your reference I feed my cats each 1/2 a can in the morning and 1/2 in the evening (so 2 cans total daily).  I am going to switch to the 12 oz cans though because they are much cheaper, you nearly double your canned food for the same price, I'm just going to buy a resealable lid and scoop out what is needed.And as a side note, my cats eat most of the food when I leave it out but they do not finish it all.  I do leave the food out for them to finish up which they usually do within 1-3 hours.  Some people say you should never do this, some say they will leave it out all day...in my experience over the 2 months I have noticed no mold, illness or rejection of this food being left out for a few hours for my cats.  The longest I've seen food remain in the is at the 7 hour mark and still, it was finished with no negative behaviors or effects noticed in either of my animals.I hope this review helps you and please be aware specifically of what goes into certain brands.  There are cheaper canned foods but they are not as good as this brand.  I've checked and tried a few.  This one is really different.  There are a few websites which explain the health benefits more precisely and if you won't take my word for it on this brand see for yourself.  Also, the cost is well worth the response you will get from your cat and when measured against prescription dry food it really hasn't been much different and the 12 oz sizes will make it even more affordable.
