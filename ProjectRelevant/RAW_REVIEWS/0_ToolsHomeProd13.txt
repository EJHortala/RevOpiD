Delivery was faster than expected.  However, when I received the machine and turned it ON, I was seriously disappointed with its performance.  The course (36 grit) wheel mounted on the right had a very bad wobble to it. Visually, it looked like 1/8", but a close measurement showed it to be little under 1/16" total side to side, enough to vibrate the machine and the bench it was sitting on. I thought about shipping everything back, but then looked at a possible $28.89 shipping charge, and decided to see if I could fix it myself.I removed both wheels and moved the wobbly right-hand (course) wheel to the left hand side. It made no difference in the wobble, so I figured it wasn\'t the mounting hardware itself. I experimented with a few layers of black electrical tape shimmed on the inside of the wheel under the mounting washer and found that four layers of tape removed the wobble almost entirely.  I also mounted two layers under the fine wheel mounting so that the small amount of wobble that it had is nearly gone. Results - an acceptable grinder.Pros: Lowest Internet price, fast shipping, OK after wheel wobble fixed as above. 8" wheels larger than motor case makes it easier to grind extended objects.Cons: Made in China, 1 bad wheel wobble, requires factory service to oil machine, no light, no quenching cup.Other comments: I found that my old 6" grinder had as much wheel wobble as the new Dewalt, but never noticed it even after several decades of use.

I thought no worries it will get scratched with me using it. Then I tried putting it together. Forget about the instruction, they were written for some thing else not a bench grinder.I then  realized I did not have all the parts. Both  the eye protection screens  were missing, along with  the two 1/4 bolts to mount  the grinder to a work bench.This is were my blood presser went up. I tried to call for help. The only help I could get was to ship it back at my expense, no go. Then I finally got hold of somebody at DeWalt to find out Black and Decker now owns them.  Therefore I paid for a product with DeWalt\'s name on with Black and Decker\'s quality. Had I know that I could have gone it Wally World and bought some cheep product there.So then I decided to use my own bolts to mount it. No go either. If you want to mount this to a wooden work bench with 2x6\'s as the working surface you will have problems. You can\'t get a bolt through the holes as the main motor is in the way. I had to strip it down, put my bolts in, then reassemble the base unit.The finally straw was once I had it all bolted down and did a power check,  I decided to change the one disk to a wire wheel. What bad engineering, you have to loosed four screws on the side cover and to do that  you have to turn the machine on its back to get to two of them. To do that you have to loosen the bolts, disassemble the base and then turn it over just to get the cover off. NOT a 5 min quick change.Do I like it now, Yes. Had I know this before hand I would not have bought a Black and Decker bench grinder with a yellow DeWalt name on it.Day 2.So after yesterdays problems I thought a new day would lead to better results. You guessed it, nope.I put the wire wheel on and could see it does not sit in the center of the housing. Therefore the tool rest is useless as the grove in the tool rest does not line up with the wheel. Also because the wheel sits further to one side it now rubs on the housing. And finally the vibrations and wobble are so bad I can\'t use it.I call customer care and they have asked me to take it to the closest service center.

The unit comes with a allen wrench and a holder for the wrench so you can adjust things.  The power cord is on the long side and is heavy and thick.

At that price, this can't be beat. Unfortunately, the right wheel came with a severe wobble. Upon inspection, I realized that the wobble was caused by the spacer that site on the drive shaft, NOT the wheel itself. The spacer had no actual symmetry; it was slightly elliptical on the outside, the central axis wasn't concentric with the outer face, and the two end faces (that contact the lip on the drive axle and the cup that contacts the wheel) were not parallel. I tried to salvage the original, but ended up having to make a new spacer in the machine shop. The wheel turns true now, and I couldn't be happier with the end result, but this is probably one of the cheaper parts on the grinder and unfortunately it only takes one bad part to turn a 5-star machine into a 3-star one.

My knowledge of grinders and how to select a good one is very limited.  I understand grinders about as much as I understand my wife.

Based on my uses of a grinder I was able to narrow it down to this one, Porter Cable, and Sears.  Like others I was very apprehensive, worried, skeptical, etc. - about making a choice.  Reviews on all makes and models were mixed with very good to very bad ratings; it almost drove me to just buy a file.  Finally I just bit the bullet and ordered this one with my fingers crossed.  The grinder arrived via FedEx in great shape.  Took my time, read the manual and had it assembled in about 45 min&#8217;s with no parts left over.  I set it on the deck, plugged it in, held my breath, and pushed the start button.  The grinder ran up to speed, was quiet, no out of round wheels, no wobble or vibration.  I let it run for about 5 min&#8217;s and it never moved at all.  What a sigh of relief and the wife can&#8217;t say &#8220;another of one of those broken things you bought off the internet&#8221;.

I can make it better or worse depending on how carefully I tighten down the wheel.  After some experimentation, I found the problem: the inner shaft sleeve (not the plates that contact the wheel, but the sleeve that the inner plate contacts).  The wobble moves to the other side when I switch the sleeves around.It vibrates intermittently during startup as it hits harmonics, but is fine at operating speeds.  I put the wire wheel on the side with the wobble where it won't matter as much.  I have not talked to DeWalt about getting a replacement sleeve, but I expect that a new sleeve would solve the problem.The grinder feels fairly solid and (I hope) well made on the whole, but some parts seem a bit chintzy.

The cone washers that hold the wheels are stamped and, as others have noted, they aren\'t necessarily flat/true.  But we also found that the shoulder on the shaft that the inside cone washer seats against had a high spot on it.  So even if I replaced or machined the cone washers, the wheel would never run true.These are simple machines: no gears or complex mechanisms, just a motor with an extended shaft.

My first purchase was shortly after Black and Decker bought the brand years ago. I've always been impressed with the quality and value of all my Dewalt tools, (7 at last count). Unfortunately as others have reported, this grinder is of very poor quality and a big disappointment. I too experienced the wooble that others have reported but to me it looks like it was the left side arbor. When I started it up after unpacking it I couldn't believe how bad it vibrated. Obviously grinders like this one need to be bolted down, but when you have a hard time holding it to the bench during the initial test run because of the excesive vibration, there's a problem. The other issues I noticed with the grinder were also previously noted by others. The color is not Dewalt yellow and the overall qulity such as the housing casting is visually very poor.My mistake for not researching better and reading all the reviews upfront, but I have always liked my Dewalt tools so much that I didn't even bother.

Before ordering, I read the customer reviews, so there seems to be a "mixed quality" of product shipping from DEWALT - thus, being aware of a possible "gamble" of what I would receive, it was a reasonable price.  I have other Dewalt products, yet this grinder, in particular soon turned into total disappointment.MOTOR/BASE FRAME CASTING: a bit on the crude side (come on now, sand castings are easy), yet did notice it was made in CHINA.  Now, cant\' blame the Chinese totally, as their product quality is driven by USA manufacturers...of which many of you are aware.I\'m a retired engineer, whether or not that means anything.  Now, right out of the box, when first powering up (slow start because of the mass of the 8" grinding wheels) the left wheel was noticeable wobbly (estimated +3/32" total wobble). This may not sound like much but for a grinder turning at 3400 rpm, that translates into a huge lateral force, which is transmitted into the bearings causing premature wear, as well as transmitting considerable vibration into the work bench, and outright noise.  It appears to me, this grinder NEVER went thru a operational quality check before shipping.  If it did, then DEWALT definitely has a quality control issue.WHEEL ADJUSTMENT:I attempted to readjust the wheel by rotating 90 deg just in case it or the clamping washers were not machined/stamped true (machining errors and all. Sometimes that helps to recenter. It has the typical Left hand and Right hand threads and the only way to loosen the wheel is to put a 1" wrench on both sides. Now, following the included instructions it took a bit of torque to loosen the wheels the first time, yet when I tried to re-tighten, there seems to be a "slight" sweet spot between tightening the LH thread side and beginning to loosen the RH thread.  I could go right thru this "sweet spot" even with my fingers, thus i could never adequately re-tighten either wheel.  And of course, there is NOT a hex in the end of the shaft or an inside shaft nut/flats to assure assure either wheel can be independently securely tightened.  Yes, there is a warning about "over tightening"!  You don\'t have to be concerned, that will never happen with this design, or at least with the one I received.CONCLUSION:The grinders I\'ve used over the years are dead nuts smooth and have NO of balance conditions.  From the years of safety training this told me, this Grinder is an "accident waiting to happen", thus, it was returned...No, I did not get a replacement DEWALT.
