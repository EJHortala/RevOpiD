None of them even come close when compared to coconut oil, either taste-wise or healthwise - yes, I said healthwise,check it out - and this "Real Theater" brand of flavored coconut oil is without question the best my wife and I have ever used. We own an old-fashioned movie theater style popcorn maker, so I can\'t vouch for popcorn made on the stove, but there\'s no reason why there should be any difference in flavor no matter how it is made. Please remember that this is coconut oil, and unlike other oils, it will tend to solidify at ambient temperatures of maybe 70 degrees F or cooler. The product label doesn\'t explain this for some reason, but it\'s a natural occurrence for coconut oil. Anyway, you can simply scoop out the amount of oil you need, but I suggest placing the container in some luke-warm water until the oil returns to a fully liquid state - maybe 5 minutes or less, and then pour out the amount needed.
