I got the game for $40, which I consider a great deal for a board game filled with so much stuff in it. All of the pieces are of great quality, the board is large and beautiful and perfectly accurate to the world of Westeros. It is a difficult game to learn, so if you're buying it I recommend either reading the instructions thoroughly beforehand and teaching the game to everyone else playing, or watch a YouTube video on a tutorial. There are many rules that are important to know.Also something I should say is that this game is truly at its best with the full six players, so if you struggle to even find four players for board games then this one might not be for you. This game also is not causal. It's long and involved, and has a lot of strategy and thinking. If the people you game with don't fit this description, you could have a hard time finding people interested to play more than once, if at all. But if you're tired of the massive amount of luck that games such as Risk have, this game is perfect for you as it is purely strategy. The only luck factor in this game is even an optional rule that you don't have to play with.I've played this game around a dozen times with my friends already, some of which watch the series and some have never.

Of do you keep it to get a better ranking on the 3 Command Tracks?  Or do you keep it and use it in case a Wilding Attack occurs?Maintaining supply lines are also important.  Do you use your token from above to keep that piece of land that give you an extra supply barrel?  Cause if you don't your army might have to reduce it's numbers to fit the supply track, which give you less tokens for the command track and wilding attacks. (I love the fact that when wildings attack, all the players have to participate in defending Westeros...or else.)Interactions and alliances between players are highly recommended.  With the use of text messages to send 'ravens' to other players in hope for support the angles this game can go can be quite generous and will add a lot of variety to each play session.  Though at the time of this review, we have yet to really do much allying and backstabbing with each other.There is a lot to like about this game.  With many options and ways to play each house.  There is much you have to watch to keep your Family strong.Cons: Not quite simple enough to pick up and play.  There are videos on youtube that have helped greatly learning this deep board game.  So watch those before you play.  But to call this a 'con' is kind of taking the fun out of learning a new game, which I very much enjoyed doing with this game.Don't know if it will ever happen, but more expansions would be great.  I do have the expansion for this, but it needs 6 players, and I haven't rounded up enough people for that type of game yet.Overall, this is a great game, taking place in a great universe, with loads of variety.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great Game', 'unixReviewTime': 1368489600, 'reviewTime': '05 14, 2013'}

{'reviewerID': 'AGBQIPH8H23SN', 'asin': '1589947207', 'helpful': [19, 72], 'reviewText': 'I have played this game 3 times. I did not enjoy the game after the first play, but decided to give it a fair chance. The #1 issue with the game is the poor balance of the different races. Some of the races have clearly better combat cards than others. I understand that the idea of playing a combat card blindly during combat is supposed to allow for mind games, but some races have cards that simply cannot lose to one of their neighbors if played optimally (at least for 3 or 4 combats in a row), so mind games are irrelevant because optimal play wins.That leads to the #2 problem with the game: making any sub-optimal move in the game causes you to lose. I have played several types of games where the main interaction is blindly playing your move, then resolving it after everyone has revealed. The mechanic itself is fine, especially if there is enough room for error to make a feint with a slightly sub-optimal move, then capitalize on your following turns. The problem here is that there are at most 10 turns in the game and it\'s arranged so that a lot of things can happen in one turn. So any attempt at a feint will turn into a game-losing sequence of events. Because of this, the only way to play the game is to always make the statistically optimal move. That means you realistically have very little choice of what to do during your turn. The essence of the game boils down to "decide what your strategy is before the game starts, always play the optimal move, and hope that your alliances hold and that no one is using a strategy that happens to exploit the weaknesses in your strategy." If you find that someone has decided on a strategy that your strategy doesn\'t cover, there is almost no way to make adjustments after the second turn to change your plan. Oh well, you lose. But you\'re still expected to sit there and go through the motions for another 2 hours.Since there is almost no way to adjust your strategy effectively once the game begins AND some races are more powerful than other races AND the only viable moves to make on your turn are the statistically optimal moves (giving you very little choice as to what you can play), most of what determines the winner of the game is out of your hands one the game begins. The game feels like everyone made their decisions before it started, then everyone tried to execute their plans more efficiently than everyone else, and everyone hopes that they chose the best plan. Anyone who does not play like this will lose to players who do play like this. Among the players who play like this, the winner is determined by everyone executing their predetermined plans.Comebacks are not a part of this game. Neither are brilliant tactical decisions. Once a player gets far enough ahead of another player, he continues to get stronger while the other player\'s strength is reduced by the game rules. Yes, the game rules are designed so that players who are winning will continue to win by an ever-increasing margin as the game progresses.There is a subset of people who enjoy games that test their ability to decide on a highly optimized strategy. Those people would like this game, because that\'s the most important skill required to win. I don\'t like that because it shifts the most important game decisions to a time before the game begins, when you\'re thinking before you make your first move. I prefer games where your "in-game" decisions make the difference.The secondary skill required to win the game is alliance making. That\'s fine, but there are many many games that do this part better (and they don\'t have all the other frustrations that this game has), so I prefer to just play those games.In addition to these complaints, I will include that the rules are overly complicated, there is a lot of down-time when you\'re sitting and waiting for other players to do stuff, and the game board was warped out of the box.As an aside, I\'ll give you an example of a set of rules that I think feels the same as this game:- Each player writes "rock," "paper," or "scissors" on a piece of paper.- Each player then chooses either the player to his left or to his right to be the target of his choice.- The pieces of paper are then revealed.- Sit around a move a bunch of plastic and cardboard for 20 minutes.- If you beat your target, you get 1 point. If someone else targeted you and beat you, you get -1 point.- If you get -1 points 2 turns in a row, you lose, but you can\'t leave.- Repeat these steps until all but on person has lost or it has been done 10 times.If you like that game, you will like A Game Of Thrones.

The issue is that there's 30 pages of rules, a great deal of mechanics every player has to learn (most are unwilling to read the rulebook), and most aspects have important qualifiers that you need to understand.This makes for a semi realistic feel where you have to strategize and plan how to allocate resources, move units, prepare for other player's decisions. I personally enjoy the depth but cannot find other people willing to sink 2 hours into learning the rules and then 6 hours into a game. My brother convinced me to buy it and said he knew people to play with. We played one night, where he and I spent most of the time explaining how to play and got through 4 rounds before people had to go to sleep. His friends didn't want to finish and this was just a HUGE waste of money in reality. It's a fun concept but people aren't into tabletop gaming like this anymore :(The issues:3 phases to each turnwithin phases you rotate around resolving one order at a time (every territory will have an order, takes a long ass time)too many mechanics that have a chance of popping up (i.e. wildling attacks, supply determination, mustering troops) all dependent on continuously shifting aspects of the gameslightly confusing unit abilities. for instance ships, sea transport, naval battles, and how ports connect to territories is all quite unclear in the rulebook (should just say ships can only attack other ships, are used as bridges for land units to attack far away territories, can be docked to consolidate power at a port but not attack, and can never attack land; rulebook has it scattered in blurbs on different pages)The fun:rewarding to outsmart your opponents with orders, you can thwart their plans with raids and give support from adjacent lands to turn the tidebattle system is dynamic, based on unit strength, fiefdom track status, and hero cards with bonuses. you can get allies to help you out and don't always lose your army when you lose a battle (especially since it's hard to amass big armies)fun heros, good houses with nice balancing in a 6-player game (tyrell might be in the middle a bit much but they should be)good map-- pretty accurate with how the novels are, especially with distribution of resources, rivers and bridges, strongholds, accessibility, etc.Overall: if you have a good gaming group and won't have to explain a billion rules to people that aren't 100% on board you will have a lot of fun. the real issue is that people lack the patience to enjoy this game and some things might be unnecessarily complex. you could argue that the complexity adds replay value, but when you don't finish one game even there's a loss of playability. most people will be drawn in by the relation to SoIF series but after getting into it, gameplay is the biggest concern. at $60 this game is VERY expensive! everything is just cardboard and plastic; they don't even punch stuff out or give you bags to store the dozens of pieces for each of the 6 houses.

Once you figure out and become comfortable with the rules the game REALLY takes off and becomes interesting.In every game so far, it has come down to the wire. It's all about calculated movements, and unlike Risk (where-in you become more and more likely to win the more territories you take) Game of Thrones forces you to strike a very delicate balance between sweeping in with masked attacks, fortifying crucial positions, and gathering resources to ensure your victory. At any given moment, any player could win/lose the game. There's this tension that every game has that makes it so exciting every turn.

Martin\'s "A Song of Ice and Fire" book series is absolutely wonderful.  It succeeds largely by presenting a grand, epic scope of wars and conflict, dragons, and wraiths, but also manages to create interesting characters and tell intimate stories.  Other key factors in the books are treachery, intrigue, and betrayal.  Fantasy Flight Games\' "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game" manages to recreate all of the thrilling adventure of the books, but most importantly offers that same great sense of back-stabbing and double-crossing.Up to six players take on the roles of the book\'s great houses, each with their own geographic starting lands on the board.  Each player commands units which can then attack other players in an attempt to be the first to capture the most castles.  The problem is that with supply caps no one house can become powerful enough to conquer the needed objectives on his own, and so must rely on the help of others to succeed.  This is dangerous, however, as someone who appears to be winning can easily face the treason of his friends.Game play resembles that of another great game, Avalon Hill\'s classic "Diplomacy."  Players place action tokens near their units face down, then reveal them more or less simultaneously.  This allows one player to promise another player the support of his military units, only to reveal that he has betrayed him at the critical moment.  It is an absolutely wonderful game mechanic that will will either cause the object of your treachery to hate you until the day you die or howl with laughter.  (Seriously, you don\'t want to play this game with people who take things like this far too seriously- you will lose friends).  Other mechanics involve auctions to gain coveted positions in the kingdom, each with their own abilities, and the threat of Wildling attacks from north of the wall.  Various other cards allow you to take certain actions each turn in a really interesting manner.All told, "A Game of Thrones: The Board Game" is just a thrilling adventure that will provide hours of entertainment with each game.

Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series. Like most people I have played my share of board games in my life, but not many more complex than Monopoly, Clue, or the occasional game of Risk. I'm sure that a more serious board gamer will review this product here in the future, so I will provide what perspective I can.This game is incredible and has made me interested in playing more serious board games in the future. I will not attempt to explain the complex rules of this game. Fantasy Flight Games's website has very helpful resources for this, including the complete rules PDF and a tutorial video.I recommend that any group intending to play this has each individually watched that tutorial video. On top of that, at least one person will need to read (at least two times probably) the rule book. Trying to explain this game to others is a tall order. However, once the game is understood and a few practice rounds done, the game takes on a life of its own.The six houses available for play are extremely well balanced and each has its own advantages and disadvantages when it comes to geographical board position, supply, influence, and unit types. These houses really each lend themselves to different play styles, but nevertheless challenge the players to do something outside of this comfort zone.For example, the Starks have a near unconquerable hold on the snowy North (as in the books). Based on the geography, if the Stark player chose he could easily defend his homeland against all comers. However, Stark will never win the game this way and it is only when he stretches his resources thin that his land is more vulnerable. Other houses such as Tyrell are thrown into the fray from the beginning and have no such defensive strategy available to them. Greyjoy has absolute dominance over the sea and if played well can serve as a naval raiding nuisance that others must band together to defeat. I suspect that players will quickly see which houses are ideal for the way they wish to play.The game is for 3-6 players and I don't really recommend 3. Without the more Southern houses, Baratheon is able to take over the territory requisite for victory pretty quickly unless the other two players band against him.  The manufacturer has made changes in this 2nd edition that have improved this kind of problem over the original, but it's still possible. 4 players is more balanced and quite fun, but 5 or 6 is ideal. The games will certainly take 2 hours at the minimum and realistically probably 3 or 4. The game length could reach up to 6 hours if the group is particularly engaged.On that note, no other game I've played does as good a job of drawing the players in as this one. The game encourages alliances as well as betrayals. With my group we would talk and roleplay somewhat during the game. Meanwhile, we opened up text messages to each other to facilitate backdoor betrayals so that other players could not hear. This is all made ten times more fun if you are a fan of the series and can get that giddy excitement by virtue of fighting over a familiar city like Harrenhal.A few other notes:- Combat is entirely luckless and based on strategy and skill. There is an optional module included that allows you to introduce a small element of luck, which I think is a good idea after a few games.- The board game components themselves are amazing. Everything feels very well designed and produced. I especially love the army units and their marbled plastic design.All in all this is just a fantastic board game, especially for those who are a fan of the book and TV series. For those who aren't, it's still an excellent game in and of itself, and it might introduce you to one of the greatest fantasy series of all time.EDIT 1/12/12:Thought I'd throw an edit into this review after some time. First of all the game is still great. The main point of this update is to say that there is an issue with the original printing of this game involving warping of the board. My board is slightly affected by this. Others have it worse and some have no issue at all. However, Fantasy Flight Games will be correcting the issue on future printings, and will be sending out free replacements to those who need them. You can contact their support via their website, they are very helpful people.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'My first foray into serious board gaming, by a major ASOIAF fan', 'unixReviewTime': 1322524800, 'reviewTime': '11 29, 2011'}

Martin's universe of a Song of Ice and Fire. Fans of the HBO series will find that they appreciate the depth of the game, but the game itself is based on the books, with extensive and impressive artwork of the characters as opposed to using the actors from the HBO series.The owner of the game should read the instructions carefully before setting off to teach other players how to play. This game's learning curve is VERY steep. Even if one of the players is experienced with it, it will take an hour or two to teach other players just how to use it. The fundamentals of the game revolve around orders, in which players instruct their armies and territories to march to claim territories, reinforce their garrisons, defend against attacks, support nearby battles, and consolidate political powers. Players use these orders to gain ground and fight other players, but the intricate details and special tactics of each order are usually not realized by novice players. For example: Armies can force march through territories by bouncing off consecutive move orders, allowing for surprisingly forceful attacks. The game is best played with more players, as the politics of it all can be more fully developed the more players the game has. Backstabbing plays a major role in an experienced game, so beware! Play as dirty as you'd like to play, but make sure that you don't take anything too personally!The artwork to the game is extraordinary and fun to look at. It can be a little overwhelming coming out of the box, as there are quite a few pieces in the game. If I could relate this to a different board game, I might relate it to Risk. It is essentially the same concept, as your armies take over territories and contest other players in the same fashion. However, this game has a certain political factor that takes its depth to a deeper level than Risk. Its learning curve may be steeper, but games don't seem as if they repeat themselves. Many unexpected events occur. I would most definitely recommend this game for anybody in to the Game of Thrones series, or tactical board games in general. If you liked Risk, you'd definitely appreciate this game.Learning Curve: 9/10 SteepA very steep learning curve makes this game a little more than some can handle at first. However, after it is learned, the game becomes very entertaining for most players. Don't give up on it!Depth: 9/10 Very DeepThe game is essentially a military tactics board game with a political essence to it. The game has a lot of depth, so even after many plays, you may still be surprised to find new tactics and strategies to use.Fun Factor: 8/10 EntertainingThis game is entertaining for most players who enjoy strategy. Some casual board gamers may be intimidated by its depth and learning curve, but once the game's potential is realized, it is generally enjoyed by most players.Presentation: 10/10 IntriguingThe artwork done by Fantasy Flight Games is astounding. The presentation of the pieces and displays are very well done, and one can appreciate the game's depth on an artistic level.Replay Value: 9/10 GreatGrudge matches are rife with this board game. Many times, players feel as if they were backstabbed or cut just short of a victory. This leads to heated rematches. There must always be a winner and a loser though, so make sure you play with good sports!Time Factor: 8/10 LongOne of the criticisms of this particular board game is its very lengthy game time. Even after its learning curve is conquered (typically after 2 hours), gamers find that they will need to continue learning new tactics to be successful. The game is very long, and is not for the impatient.Overall: 9/10This game is excellent! If you enjoy it, I would also recommend other games by Fantasy Flight Games. One suggestion is Battles of Westeros, a game done entirely with miniatures and significant military strategic depth. I hope you enjoy yourself, and that you become a fan of FFG as well!", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Innovative and Immersive', 'unixReviewTime': 1359244800, 'reviewTime': '01 27, 2013'}

I\'ve been a boardgame geek now for about ten years, and I\'ve played well over a hundred different board and/or card games (mainly European) from every existing genre. I also own several games, and A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second Edition (GoT) is one of the only games I would never even consider trading or selling.The Facts:The game plays three to six players. The rule set is actually considered simple for a war-strategy game (less complex than Axis and Allies yet slightly more complex than Risk), and anyone can learn the basics in under half an hour of instruction. Otherwise, the rules manual is very well organized and easy to follow if a newbie would rather just read it. A typical six-player game (recommended) can last anywhere between four and six hours, depending on the players\' experience. The game does have a finite clock set to ten rounds, so even heavy "analysis paralysis" amongst players won\'t make the game last forever. Fans of the HBO series and/or books who have not completed the story need not fear of spoilers as the game does not deal with any actual events from the books (it does reveal the names and associated Houses of characters and places through book three, but nothing that\'s going to spoil anything for you). An optional card deck called "Tides of Battle" is also included, allowing for a more Risk-like element of luck to be utilized when playing (actually quite fun). The 2nd edition of the game includes the Southern Expansion as part of the main board, as well as those updated rules and corresponding House cards. This edition does NOT include the most recent expansion.The Pros:For the most part, GoT has a very taught rule set, minimizing loopholes and/or contradictory rules that plague many lesser war strategy games. After a couple play-throughs, I also found most of the rules to be quite intuitive and easy to remember. This is a HUGE plus for a game with so much going on, and because there is so much going on at any given time, GoT is incredibly engaging. Hours really do seem like minutes when playing. I\'ve had six-hour sessions only to be frothing at the mouth to play again. one of the more fun scenarios of the game is when every player must bid against one another on the influence tracks. Sometimes the bidding wars are more fun than the actual combat! Another plus to this game is its beautiful design and artwork. No expense was spared on what you receive out of the box, making it intrinsically worth every penny.The Cons:After about ten play-throughs so far, I\'ve really only found one potential gripe, and many may not even consider it to be a negative. Basically, the game can be so much fun at times that an easy trap for a player (especially a newcomer) to fall into is to lose sight of the object of the game, which is to acquire the most castles and/or strongholds by the end of round ten (acquiring seven makes for an immediate win). If that is not your ultimate goal, then you\'re not really playing the game. Often times players will spend most of the game either backing an alliance that they\'ve struck or carrying out personal vendettas, forgetting that they themselves must have the most castles to win! Though that can be frustrating for competitive players, it also just points to the game\'s extreme fun factor. You really can lose yourself in it.So if you\'re a fan of the books/series and you appreciate an accessible war strategy game, then GoT is a must-have for your game closet. My friends and I now dedicate entire days (or nights) to convening for a session or two, and never have we walked away without grins on our faces.

{'reviewerID': 'A2PTCG1D5NJT0H', 'asin': '1589947207', 'reviewerName': 'Maxwell', 'helpful': [5, 5], 'reviewText': 'When people hear A Game of Thrones most immediately think of the HBO television program marked by its quantity of sex scenes. Others think of the first novel of George R. R. Martin\'s Song of Ice and Fire series that the television series is based on. However, there are even more adaptions of Martin\'s book series including comic books, video games and even action figures.However, it might surprise many to discover that there is actually an award winning board game based on Martin\'s grand fantasy also named A Game of Thrones, and after you spend an evening backstabbing and politicking with your former friends, you\'ll understand why it\'s worth knowing.A Game of Thrones is a military strategy board game where the goal is to capture as many castles scattered across Westeros as possible. It is published by Fantasy Flight Games, who are known for such boards games as the surreal Arkham Horror and the leviathan of gaming, Twilight Imperium along with the increasingly popular "Living Card Games" of various themes. A Game of Thrones was originally released in 2003 many years before the popular television show. After a few expansion packs, the game was updated and then consolidated into a second edition released in 2011, which is the subject of this review.I\'m already pleased when I look at the box. The box art is not based on the television show, but is simply drawn pictures, all of which are aesthetically pleasing. However, once you open the box you realize how much trouble this game will be. Before your first game you\'ll spend some time punching out all the pieces before your first game, which number in the hundreds. The rulebook isn\'t too thick, but before the first game it should be read cover to cover by at least one player. However, the other players can watch a video on Fantasy Flight\'s website that will really speed up the learning curve. Setting up the game isn\'t too complicated, but if you don\'t have the full six players placing the neutral forces can get tedious.When you finally get started playing, you can choose to play as a few of the great houses of Westeros. In a three players game your options are Starks, Lannisters and the Baratheons. The fourth player adds the Greyjoys, fifth player adds the Tyrells and the sixth player adds the Martells. Each house has their own unique starting location on the map, and they are appropriately unbalanced, adding an interesting layer to the game. However, each house has their own "House Cards" which are different leaders you can have to command your troops in battle, each with their unique effect. It becomes abundantly clear by looking at the leaders that this game does not take place within the official Song of Ice and Fire timeline and never could. This decision was most likely made to avoid any spoilers, which many can appreciate.Once the gameplay begins any player who has played Avalon Hill\'s Diplomacy will feel right at home, though there are touches of the classic Axis and Allies, orders are chosen in secret and all players reveal theirs simultaneously and players are forced to cooperate to get ahead. However, combat is much different as units move and attack much differently. The combat even removes elements of chance that plagued games like Axis and Allies, it\'s still a thinking man\'s game. If you fail it\'s because you were outwitted. This game simply feels like a vast and direct improvement to Diplomacy and Axis and Allies.However, the true shining moment comes in the use of power tokens. Power tokens are used to claim territories without leaving an occupying force, bidding for your influence over the King\'s Court, Fiefdoms and Iron Throne and even donating forces to the Nightwatch to tackle the Wildling threat. All of this seems complicated and is very hard to articulate, but in action is quite simple and has a wonderful impact on the game.One of the best things about this game is accessibility. It\'s natural to expect that this game would be rather confusing for someone unfamiliar with the source material, but that couldn\'t be further from the truth. Half our players the first time we played hadn\'t read the books or had seen the show, the winner being one of those. However, while this game says it\'s for three to six players, you definitely want five or six. With three players there is almost no diplomacy and with only four it becomes too easy for the Lannisters or the Baratheons to go south and take enough territory to win the game with little trouble. A lot of the players I\'ve seen play the game weren\'t very acquainted with board games in general, but after the initial learning of the rules, they had no issue with the game.Overall the game captures the politics and betrayal that marks the series that inspired it while also being one of the most enjoyable military strategy games on the market. If you bring this to game night, your friends will love you until you all inevitable betray them to seize the throne for yourself.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'A Worthy End to Friendships', 'unixReviewTime': 1359331200, 'reviewTime': '01 28, 2013'}

So much of the game is based on alliances and the right strategies.We have played four games so far.  Three of them had six people and the other one had four.  First off I want to say that the Westeros cards have made it so each of the four games have gone completely different.  Its too hard to explain without explaining all of the rules, but more or less at the start of each round there are a series of cards that are drawn at random.  Depending on what those cards do the game will change accordingly.  One game it was a while before we were really able to make a lot of troops, another game there were so many troops on the board so fast the map was just one big powder keg.  In the games we have played there has been great shifts in power within the games.  The latest game we played, we were more than halfway into the game and all six houses still had an equal chance of winning.  Diplomacy is the key.  You need players who know what they're doing, players who aren't afraid to backstab a good friend.  I have never been more addicted to a board game in my life.  Just try to make sure you have six people who can think strategically.  (We have actually been nerdy enough that we do all of our diplomacy through text messaging so we can communicate while looking at the map and not let the other houses know what our messages are)So all in allPros:1.  Surprising Game balance2.  Awesome replay value.  We've played four games, all four games have gone differently not just based on alliances but based on the randomized Westeros cards3.  Forces diplomacy.  If you're going against strategic minds you're going to have to make alliances just like in the books.4.  Great attention to detail with house cards - cool powers that change strategies and alter games.Cons:1.  The rules are a bear.  I almost didn't want to put this on cons since I think its also what allows it to be such a great game.  But I can see how they can be intimidating.  There have been some minor rules that we even initially messed up in one game, fixed it in another game, etc.2.  We feel Tyrion and Melisandre are underpowered in their house card powers.

It\'s a challenging game to play, the rule book is extensive, but the rewards are worth it.  You need at least 3-6 players, so it won\'t work as a couple\'s game.  However, if you have some friends to play with this will be the perfect addition to your game collection.Without going into too many details, here is the basic play of the game:1) Turn up event cards that affect the game/round immediately.2) Place "order tokens" face down next to your armies.  All players reveal their orders simultaneously, and based upon turn order each player executes their actions.3) Clean up and prepare for the next round.One of my favorite parts of the game is the ability to forge alliances with other players.  You can agree to support each other in battle, or plan strategies to outmaneuver players that are in a better position to win the game.  Blind bidding is another aspect of this game that I absolutely love.  There are three "Influence Tracks" that you can bid on at certain points throughout the game that can vastly affect how you play the game.  there is also bidding against neutral "Wildlings" that can cause some tense situations.One issue I do have with this game is that the six different families don\'t seem very balanced.  Starting positions and their particular cards (which influence battle) seem to favor certain families over others.  However, this is where the alliances come in.  You have to make sacrifices and work with others if you want to make it through this game.  At any given point you never know who\'s actually trying to help you.Having never read the books or watched the HBO series, I\'m coming to this game from a purely game loving background.  As such, I find this game simply amazing.  If you are playing with the right group of people you will be very pleased with the intensity this game offers.Update: 2/6/13  Unfortunately, I haven\'t had any chances to play with more than 3 players since I got this game.  IMO, 4 is the minimum to really make the game interesting, but 6 is definitely the optimum.  However, I have played a "6 player" game with my brother where each of us controlled 3 armies each.  Although not the perfect way to play, it demonstrated how amazing this game can be.  If only I had 5 others who wanted to play with me . . . .Also, there is an available expansion to this game (A Dance with Dragons is the title).  It REQUIRES 6 people to play, and it shifts the power greatly.  The expansion includes new character cards for each family (some of these cards have very interesting effects), and the army layout is completely different, leaving some armies spread thin with others relatively consolidated.  It\'s definitely worth a look if you have 6 players that enjoy this game.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Excellent strategy game', 'unixReviewTime': 1332892800, 'reviewTime': '03 28, 2012'}

It takes a while to learn the rules, and it is defiantly easier to learn to play from another person than by just trying to read through the 26 pages of instructions. After playing 5 or 6 times we were still finding new subtleties to the rules we hadn't remembered at first. This being said, it is TOTALLY worth the effort. This game is dynamic, strategic, exciting, and has great re-play value. As a enthusiast for the Game of Thrones books, it's quite entertaining as well. Even my friends who haven't read the books say its a very fun game. It does take a long time to play - usually upwards of 5 hours especially at first. I've never resented it this fact, though, because every second was so enjoyable. Unlike Risk or Monopoly you don't end with the slow and painful process of waiting two of those hours for the obvious front runner to sweep the board. Power dynamics change quickly throughout game play. It is easy to become extremely invested in your campaign. Rules, though extensive, are generally intuitive and defiantly facilitate the most realistic conquest game I've ever played. You have to take into account your access to supplies in building up your armies, for example. You can form alliances with other players, then betray them.

Adding ports, removing Robb from the Starks (he's back but with a much less game-breaking ability on his card), setting up the Martells in the south to compete directly with Baratheon as well as Tyrell are all important steps. To me the biggest change though is adding that starred * Consolidate Power tokens now allow the faction to Muster, in that square, a number of points equal to the strength of the castle/stronghold (ie 0/1/2) there-- without a Mustering card. In doing so you sacrifice the 1/2 power tokens though. Adds a lot of depth, not to mention strategic choice, early in the game.However, the game really could have gone through some play testing. The Greyjoys now have ridiculous House Cards, so, with just a little careful husbanding and an early first clash of kings, they can wipe the Lannisters entirely out of the game. There are very few defensive moves Lannisport can make. (One game they used their *Consolidate Power every turn to pump out ships, but even with a fleet of 3+2=5 (their supply max), the Greyjoys wiped them out with a mere 2 ships (because they'd held both stars and the Sword, but mostly because of the House Card Victarion Greyjoy). Just nothing they can do about it.)Further there is a noted problem with the boards shipping warped and being of poor quality.All in all with 5 or 6 people, the game is fun.

These rules are complicated at first, and the book is a beast; I don\'t find it very well organized but I\'m sure some people would disagree.

It is pretty much Risk on Steroids. It is so complex, yet so rich and once you get the game rules down it is just an awesome fun game to play. What I love about it is that unlike Risk, the main factor of game is all about the alliances. You can not survive on your own, but put your trust in the friends you make, but you have to be so careful and watchful, because every move you make can either alter your chances to victory or defeat within a turn and when the game is near the end, your 'friends' will most likely betray you. Also what I love about it is the unpredictability of what can happen every round. Not only with the people you play with, but the 'Westeros' cards can either help or screw people over badly. And another thing is that luck is not a factor unless with play with 'Tides of war cards'. It's all based on strategy and no dice!

{'reviewerID': 'AMEZVNCZWNEKU', 'asin': '1589947207', 'reviewerName': 'Strahd', 'helpful': [4, 5], 'reviewText': '"Winter is Coming" - House StarkWith the Game of Thrones TV show at an all time high, I thought this would be a great time to introduce the A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed. to those fans who many not know about it or who or not savvy with the latest rage of board games. A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed. is put out by the board game publishing juggernaut Fantasy Flight Games located in Roseville, MN and is based on George R.R. Martins bestselling book series "A Song of Ice and Fire."A Game of Thrones The Board Game 2nd Ed. is set up to play three to six players. With rules to adjust for the amount of players in the game. The game itself is not for the casual gamer per sey. It\'s a long game of strategy that can easily go over four hours but oh what a four hours it is! All the theme and feel you could ever want in a strategy game is locked in this incarnation. All the houses: Stark, Lannister, Baratheon, Tyrell, Greyjoy and Martell, are in this game as you battle for territory in Westeros with political intrigue, back stabbing and hard fought war campaigns.First off let me tell you about the quality of the game itself. The components are outstanding. The board and artwork are top notch and to me really provide a rich, warm gaming experience which I love. I think it\'s important to feel like you are a "part" of the game in the sense of actually being their and the new version does this a bit better than the original version released 10 years ago. The map is large and easy to grasp and gorgeous in imagery and laid out so no matter where you sit, everything is easy to reach and understand.The rule book is pretty well laid out so that even though there is a lot in it, it is not real hard to understand. If you read it a couple times you should be able to get a good handle on the basic operation of the game and only need to refer for special situations hopefully. Also included in the game are two quick reference sheets help shorten the game by not needing to dig in the rule book. Each player gets a screen to hide their tokens with more quick reference tidbits which is another great help to keep gameplay time down.You vie for control of the Iron Throne while trying to be the first to acquire a total of seven castles and strongholds before the 10th round ends. If no one has acquired seven castles by the end of the 10th round, then whomever has the most wins.During the game you have phases that you go through that the player order is determined by who controls the Iron Throne and the order of players that follow down the influence track (which is bid upon during "The Clash of Kings".) You have the Westeros Phase" (skipped in round one), the Planning Phase and the Action Phase.The Westeros Phase concludes advancing the game round maker, drawing  Westeros cards which may have to be resolved and advancing the Wildlings track. You may have to deal with the Wildlings in which the players secretly bid an amount of power tokens to stop them. There is a consequence to the players who bid the least if the threat is not beaten.The Planning Phase is where you assign orders (in secret by placing them upside down on the board) such as raids, marches, defense, consolidate power or support tokens. Raid tokens allow you to possibly interrupt another players token, hence messing up their plans and causing a bit of frustration. Always a fun tactic in a game like this. March tokens allow to advance on another players position or empty position for combat and taking over that territory if successful. Defense tokens are self-explanatory and help bolster your defense from attack from opposing players. Consolidate Power tokens allow you to  gain power tokens for bidding later in the game or to muster units (armies) into an assigned area.The Action Phase begins with resolving raid orders based on the order of players on the Iron Throne Track. All moves in this phase are based on this order. Note this means that if you have a five player game, then the first player resolves one order, then the second player etc... in order and comes back around to the first player if any tokens are left to be resolved. March orders are next, again one battle at a time per player and finally Consolidate Power tokens. Then you clean up the board making sure armies and tokens are removed from the board.Combat is resolved by first a call for support. Here you may ask for a players support and they may or may not help you. They may decide to help the other player instead. This gives said player a bonus based on the support played. You then calculate strength of both sides and include the "Valyrian Steel Blade" token (explained later). Then you choose a "House Card" from your hand to help you with a strength bonus and hopefully a text that will hurt the opponent. This is then calculated as the Final Combat Strength. Combat resolution is: Determine the victor, casualties, retreating and routing and clean up.During the game you will have the opportunity to silent bid on the three tracks when the "Clash of Kings" card appears during the Westeros phase. The first track is the Iron Throne Track which determines the order players go in and allows who ever holds this token the ability to break ties outside of combat. The Fiefdoms Track allows whomever holds the "Valyrian Steel Blade" to win all combat times and add +1 to their combat strength. This may only be used once per turn. The King\'s Court Track determines the amount of special order tokens available to each player. It also allows the holder of the "Messenger Raven" token to change on of his or her orders that was placed before the action phase begins and the order tokens are revealed.You also have ports and ships in the game. This allow for unit movements over large areas and ship to ship battles as well. An extremely important part of the game and critical to winning in my opinion if done right. Obviously House Greyjoy starts off strong in this type of unit.The units in this game are Footman (1 unit each), Knights (2 units each), Ships (1 unit each) and Seige Engines (2 points each.) Based on your Supply Track on the board determines how many units and the size of each army allowed per house. Taking over territories with barrels in them and holding them when a "Mustering" card comes up will allow you to increase your army of force you to decrease in the case of having more units than you can support with food.Strongholds are the larger castles that allow of two points of mustering and castles allow for 1 point of mustering. Again this happens when the "Mustering" card appears during the Westeros Phase. If you control enough territories with barrels then new units will appear at these places.The alliances you form in this game are a major part of the game play. You can try and align with a player but beware as there are no rules to the players actually doing what is agreed to. They may be secretly plotting with someone else at the same time. While you may align with someone, you are never allowed to show hidden order tokens or silent bids. You also may not bribe anyone with power tokens, dominance tokens, cards or any other type of piece of the game. This part is all about trust and not for the weak of heat."I did warn you not to trust me." - LittlefingerThere are other parts of the game that come into play such as Neutral Force or Garrison tokens. This stops you from just walking in someplace to take it over. You have to actually commit units to a battle to grab that territory.In my opinion this is my favorite game of all time. The amount of political backstabbing, tension from the placing of orders and whether or not you just made a mistake based on alliances with other players provides so much atmosphere and incredible game play that is hard not to love. You don\'t find that a lot in games these days.Although there is a lot to it, the game is pretty easy to grasp after a couple of rounds. Don\'t let the length of time dissuade you from trying it. It is well worth the time and money it costs ($49.95 retail). The theme is excellent, the game itself is well done in terms of art, components and rules.I give it a 10 out 10 stars and highly recommend it to any board game fan and especially to Game of Thrones fans.This game is Geek Approved!A Game of Thrones: The Board Game Second EditionYou can find the original review here: http://geekeccentric.com/a-game-of-thrones-2nd-ed-board-game-review/', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'A Game of Thrones 2nd Ed.

I am by no means a serious board game player and not into board games all that much. I have only played board games a handful of times these last few years with Monopoly being the most complex and I have played RISK maybe 5-10 times my whole life so don\'t be scared to try this game if you think is too hard.I have played this game 4 times now with only casual board game players like myself and the overwhelming majority of them have enjoyed it. It did help that most of them were fans of the show as well but once you get into the game you really enjoy it and lose track of time as you are constantly planning your next move, who to form an alliance with, whether to betray a current alliance etc. So even those not familiar with the show will enjoy it!What I really like about the game is it\'s mostly strategy that will determine whether you win or lose, though luck will always play some roll. It\'s important to mention the game comes with an optional add-on(Tides of Battle cards) that creates that extra bit of chance for those who prefer that.As for the complexity of the game it really is easy once you start playing it. What makes it feel complex is that there are a lot of rules and things to keep up with, but it\'s quite simple to follow them once you\'ve played for a few rounds (though you will find yourself correcting things that were being played wrong in subsequent games).What I would suggest for casual board game players to do is read the rules once, watch a youtube video (there\'s quite a few out there but this one I found to be the most helpful [...] and just start a practice simulated game. The one good thing about the instructions is that they are set out in the order that the game will be played so you can play a simulated game as you read the rules. It really only takes a few game rounds to get the gist of it, off course some things will require re-reading as with any game.I\'ll mention again that setting up the game and playing a simulated game as you read the rules will REALLY help you understand the game!The one thing to take into consideration when buying this game is that it will take 3-5 hours to complete. The more experienced the players the less time it will take but I always tell new players to expect to play for 5 hours. Be sure the people you play with know this so everyone\'s into the game when you are crossing that 3hr mark.(which actually goes by fast when you\'re playing the game)In conclusion it\'s a really entertaining game and even casual gamers will like it. It\'s a game that will make you think and give you a "can\'t wait till my next turn" feeling. Like the show the game will bring out unusual alliances and backstabbing which just makes it more fun! For fans of the show it\'s great to use the character you like and playing the board game gives you a sense of the territory of Westeros and the advantages/disadvantages the families have.If you are unsure because you think it might be too complex don\'t be, the game is a lot of fun and after a few times playing it you will find yourself(as other reviewers have mentioned) interested in similar strategy based board games!', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'GREAT GAME.

Each round goes quickly once you get the hang of it.The part I really like which distinguishes it from many other strategy or resource based games is that there are so many areas to choose to focus on.  The section of the board called the "Influence Tracks" ranks your dominance in three areas.  You can control the Iron Throne, giving you the ability to break ties and take your turn first.  Your position in the Fiefdom track gives you an advantage in battle. Or you can control the King\'s Court, allowing you advantages in sending orders and obtaining information.  Another area called the Supply track controls the number of armies you can have in play. Like the books, these Influence and Supply Tracks gave the game levels upon levels of strategy.The game itself is beautiful and well made.

There are a lot of rules, but if you do all of the things above and you shouldn't have any problems.  I had fun every time but noticed a problem when playing with Greyjoys.  Greyjoys can win Riverun on turn one no matter what Lanisters do.  Some people will say its broken, its not but if you don't play smart an aggressive Greyjoy can possibly wipe out Lanister.  To counter this you Lanister needs to play defensively, and ask for assistance.  The best thing a Lanister can do is form an alliance between them and Greyjoy.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Great game with a small balance issue', 'unixReviewTime': 1370563200, 'reviewTime': '06 7, 2013'}
