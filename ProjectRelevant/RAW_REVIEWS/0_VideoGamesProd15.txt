This game is the first game that does the Star Trek name sound even better. Activision did a very good job in creating this game, they have managed to bring the Star  Trek feeling to your home PC. The game takes you through five campaigns,  Federation, Klingon, Romulan and the Borg. In the final campaign the first  three races bind together to defeat the Borg. The storyline has been nicely  woven through the game and is an important part of the game. The between  games animations are great and there are very good voice overs from the  original crew. The gameplay is also great, it is foing to take some getting  used to, but once you are it feels great. Relatively new options such as:  Scout and Search and Destroy make the game even more playable. The game  looks much like Starcraft, only better. You can Zoom in to the ships so far  that you can see them in full glory, it's almost like in the movies. This  ofcourse is useless to play with, but it still looks great! The in-game  sound is also fantastic, you can hear real voices from the series and the  sound of the weapons is also great. There is just one point of comment, the  game can be a little &quot;buggy&quot; at some times, but this is will be  overcome when you download the upgrades from the Activision homepage.

In this game, the ships you produce behave much like footmen in Warcraft 3, the only difference being that your ships can be seen dogfighting and shooting each other with phasers and from time to time, being assimilated.The function of ships also carries a few flaws, and the races are diverse enough to offer a few different options to battle, but for the most part, the same strategy works for any race: Blockade an enemy base and use built (or captured) artillery vessels to pummel its defenses until you can safely attack with your battlefleet.The games economy is also overly simplified, starbases produce officers, a unit cap, each starbase you control adds to your crew pool ( a resource you will never find yourself running short of) and dilithium moons provide the only demand resource.  Gameplay therefor has the same frustrating tendancy seen in Starcraft, victory is a function of who can gather the most dilithium the fastest, and not a question of who can outwit thier opponents.The scaling on the ships is also terribly off.  A Soveriegn is a fine, powerful ship, but it should not be able to singlehandedly eliminate three borg cubes, and although I understand this was a balance issue, I feel that it ultimately detracts from the games potential.The next borg related quam I have here is the borg art.  They have chosen to use a mesh-like mass to represent the borg utilitarian look, all wires and pipes and stuff showing on the surface, but it rather just ends up looking like a big green (or try pink as your player color, that's really funny) blob that is only reminiscent of a borg cube.Where this game shines, and it does a little, is in its singleplayer campaigns, which have a decent set of storylines and some good voice talent.  The federation campaign has the benefit of Patrick Stewart and Micheal Dorn, Stewart reprising locutus for the borg campaign, and as a special surprise to those who were her fans, Denise Crosby returns as the wily Admiral Sela, to champion the romulan cause in a souped up D'Deridex.Overall, it's not a bad game, but given that Armada 2 exists, it pales and loses a lot of its appeal.", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Try and find Armada 2 if you can', 'unixReviewTime': 1167264000, 'reviewTime': '12 28, 2006'}

You get the latest game to hit the compters, Star Trek Armada.  Now you can control multiple starships ranging from Federation, Klingon, Romulan and our favorite, the Borg.Following some of the same guidlines found in Blizzard's Starcraft, you must play 4 chapters in the struggle with a fight to fend off the Borg.  You mine dilitium moons and build starbases in space to amass huge armadas of ships to do battle with.  Each chapter focuses on a specific race that you must control and successfully complete each mission.  It does make for some fun game play and insight into a story created for this game.The graphics are very nice and you do get a sense of what it is to control ships and manage space stations in space.  Although alot of the screen is taken up by menu boxes that can be removed, the ability to zoom out my have you scrolling like crazy to manage your space battles.  As for the cutscences, they are not anything to write home about, but they are nice.The gameplay is a little awakward to get used to.  You are limited on what you can build depending on your mission and even then it is time consuming to build up a sizeable force.  This would have been taken care of if you were able to manipulate your ships more instead of moving near another ship and firing.  I really wish they would have allowed you to allow your ships to make evasive manuevers rather than just sit next to enemy and exchange fire until one is dead.  The ability to have more control over a few ships would not make it necessary to amass huge armies of ships to attack the enemy terriortory.

There is little here for the non-avid Star Trek fan.  I personally love  Star Trek, and have watched the series since the first episode of The Next  Generation aired.  This release lends itself very well toward Star Trek  fans aching to take hold of the Enterprise-E, the Defiant, a Romulan  Warbird, and so on.Although this game does have a 3D engine, and a  cinematic mode, chances are that the most of the time will be spent in a  top-down strategic view.  The cinematic view is nice to pop to during  controlled battles, but otherwise, it's pretty useless (although it does  sometimes remind you of some of the Star Trek TV scenes).The graphics  are decent, but no marvel.  The engine is solid, but nothing fancy or  extravagent.  The thing that gets this release such support from ST fans is  the sound.  Your favorites can be easily recognized in the sound bytes.  Phasors, photon torpedos, the stunning female voice of standard Federation  ships.  That, included with speech recorded by Patrick Stewart, Michael  Dorn, and some of the other well-known Next Generation and DS9 actors,  makes for a wonderful feeling of Star-Trek-ness.  Although the ship  commands do get very repetitive.  Something about Worf continually  screaming &quot;Get us out of here, maximum warp!&quot; continually when  you click a space an inch away...  However, the sound quality (at a  decently high volume) isn't perfect.  Lots of noise can be heard in the  background of the voices.

I can envision  an Armada with brilliant, digital voices and sound effects that trumpet  along with a beautiful crystal-clear soundtrack...

In fact, it is quite possibly the only game that does any of the Star Trek games justice. I've played the game for quite some time and would certainly recommend it to other players. However, before you invest your money I must point out several pitfalls of this game that could push some customers away.When I first played this game I was astounded by how real the entire Star Trek universe became. Fluid ship movements and photon torpedos, warp drives, phasers, and the whole nine-yards blew me out of my seat. However, the terrible programming soon distracted me from my moment of enthusiasm.Star Trek Armada is an extremely fun game to play, yet the bugs cannot be overlooked. I have an 800 mhz PC with a 64mb GeForce Video Card and the movies are very choppy on my system. This was extremely detrimental to the realism of the campaigns.If you're into multiplayer, you'll soon see that the multiplayer community is extremely small. The game is patched rarely if ever, and half of the online gaming community speak doesn't even speak English very well (There are many German players). There is a &quot;cheat&quot; that is known by many veterans that also allows you to build buildings anywhere on the screen. Don't be surprised if you see an enemy starbase appear in the middle of your base!If you are a new player and try to get online to fight your battles, be wary. There are many established &quot;clans&quot; and new players aren't readily accepted. Also, if you're looking for a large online community, you're looking in the wrong place. Yet, the quality of the game outshines the bad programming and this is an excellent addition for anyone who enjoys a good RTS game or is a Star Trek fan. You'll lose a good deal of sleep with this game!Pros:Massive variety of ships and special weapons.Excellent Animation.Decent Playbalance.Cons:Terrible multiplayer latency (lag).Small multiplayer community (less than 100 players at all times).EXTREMELY buggy code for a publisher such as Activision.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'A truly great RTS game flawed by programming.', 'unixReviewTime': 978134400, 'reviewTime': '12 30, 2000'}

The single player instant action comes with several different maps built, I just think it would have been cool to include a way to make your own map as well (I seem to recall seeing one out on the net somewhere - probably cheatplanet.com or something). Mission re-playability isn't a big deal either, because once I play thru a mission-only game, I usually don't go back to it too often.

Well it's beat crappy but still  interesting for to see plot develop instead of directly implementing from  TV shows or movie.  Nevertheless, there are few things I was really bugged.  First is why did they make Defiant class warship and Klingon Bird of Prey  so weak.

At a first glance Armada appears tto do just that. However, beneath the glamarous surface, Armada hides a rather dissapointing game play.The graphics of Armada are fantastic, truly capturing the different ships and creatures in their best lighting, you could truly be looking at the special effects of a Star Trek episode when zoomed in. However, the gameplay is frankly, dull. The sides all have different units, but underneath they are virtually identical. While the federation Sovereign and Romulan D'deridex Warbird look completely different and have two different special weapons, otherwise they have identical shield and weapon values. The reaces each have a scout ship, which are all equally powerful, a destroyer type ship, alll equally powerful, a cruiser, all equally powerful etc.The different special weapons hardly make up for this, and the base defences are far to powerful and effective, meaning that you need only your command centre and a few torpedo turrets to survive any attack. Also, the simplistic units mean that once you've reached the most advanced level, there is never any need for you to purchase the more primitive ships.The campaigns ar ealso depressingly short, a mere four missions for each race then four bonus missions at the end, and the missions are dull, sparked only by a few special ships. There is no real difference between playing as any of the different races.It's not that Star Trek Armada is a particularly bad game, it's just that there are so many ways in which it could easily be improved.

I'm not sure if  developers are intimidated by the fame of the series, or if there simply  aren't very many programmers who can handle the Wing Commander level many  of us gamers expect from a good space game. While Armada is better than  most, it still could be so much more.Yes, you can be one of four groups  - the Federation, the Klingons, the Romulans, or the Borg. Each has its own  ships and bases, and special abilities. The graphics are Homeworld-esque -  very lovely, with details on ships and other stellar objects.I grew up  loving Star Trek, and it is neat to be able to manipulate the ships.  However, playing is like sliding miniatures around on a glass tabletop.  Where is the space aspect of this? Scales are not always proper as they  slide from Point A to Point B. You do traditional StarCraft types of  operations - mine your dilithium, build your base, kick out fighting units,  take out the enemy. Instead of choosing an attack stance, you choose the  red/yellow/green alert.Getting into the game is extremely difficult for  new players. The manual itself is not very helpful, and the commands are  not always intuitive. One of our test machines was a P2-266, which they  list as supported, but the machine only ran at the lowest graphic setting  available, choking constantly. Even on faster systems the crash rate is  rather impressive.I really, really wanted to enjoy this as a strategy  game. My love of Trek tried to get me to overlook some of the flaws.  However, no matter how gorgeous the ships themselves and the generated  mid-game cinematics, the AI is simply lacking and the gameplay itself is  nothing special when compared to other strategy games out there.If  you're a Trek lover, grab a copy to play with the ships.

First off, it has the longest install process  of any game I have ever played, and I have a 48x CD-ROM drive. Second, the  interface is monstrous, even though it looks elegant and simple. While  positioning ships is easy, (and it should be since they only move in 2  dimensions), there is no real sense of scale, plus they have a tendency to  `bump' into objects like space stations and other ships. Secondly, the  instant they see an enemy ship, any vessel you control within weapons'  range automatically opens fire, taking interaction down a notch. Also  unlike Homeworld the user cannot assign formations to his ships, making  dispersement messy.When the game starts the user is treated to a  rather nicely rendered opening scene with lots of fleet action between  Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg vessels that culminates on an all-out  run on Borg Cubes. (Though one wonders how Picard can face down Locutus  since they are the same guy. Did the Borg clone Picard?) Unfortunately, the  game doesn't deliver anywhere near the excitement generated by a 3 minute  opening segue. At the title screen you have a choice to play a series of  missions as either the Federation, Klingon, Romulan and Borg and they all  must be played before arriving at the finale mission. Overall, the game  seems to have been slapped together to capitalize on the franchise, lacking  both the quality and substance that LucasArts has put into their Star Wars  line of games. Armada lacks the epic scope of similar games like Homeworld  or even Starcraft. If you changed the space scapes to ground and the  starships to Zerg or Protoss units, Armada would be Starcraft, except not  as much fun.Armada prolongs the Star Trek game curse when it should  have shattered it. The prospect of moving a fleet of Defiant and Sovereign  class starships around the screen should have been an easy game to create.  Perhaps if Activision had optioned the Homeworld engine for Armada, things  would have been different. However, on the upside, the rendered starships  do look nice, as does the 3D lighting for all of the effects shots. Getting  Patrick Stewart, Michael Dorn, and Denise Crosby to do voices will probably  get die-hard Trek fans to purchase the game to feed their pirana-like  frenzy for franchise merchandise, but style should never win out over  substance in a game like this.

This may be ok in Warcraft, but in the  post Star Craft world, there is really no excuse for not making the races  seperate but equal. The Borg are by far the most individual of the races,  with the ability to assimilate the opponents vessels. While all the races  can board and capture enemy vessels, the Borg have it best with the  assimilation ability of the Cubes. Armada has a lot going for it, fun  gameplay, great graphics, and interesting storyline.

It wouldn't seem game where you spend most of your time building a base in space (hehe rhymed) would be all that much fun, but this game delivers on the promise of fun action-based real time strategy.  Some of the other ST RTS games that were released tended to be somewhat tedious from time to time, but this game never real got bogged down in the minutia that can plague RTS games.  You never really feel like you are harvesting resources simply to be harvesting resources.In some RTS games, you do three things most of the time.  You either chop wood (harvest resources), build a keep (construct your base), or attack/defend.  While it is true that you do those things in this game, you are doing them while stealing the enemy's forces, resources, and buildings.  Warcraft, Starcraft, and the innumerable other RTS games that litter the field just don't compare to this rather light-hearted game which never gets heavy-handed in the guidance of your play style.

I first played this with a 4mb Graphics card which was really slow but my enthusiasm for the game was so great, I set all the graphical details to it's bear minimum for it to operate at a good frame rate...but now I enjoy it even more. Ships are rendered brilliantly as are all the little features in the galaxy maps. Strange space anomaly's and particals which float in space can be to your advantage or disadvantage...this game has it all.My final verdict despite this review being short is that this game is one of my must buys.

Yes, it's more, ahem, engaging than your average Star Trek game, but it does nothing to improve  upon the strategy genre as a whole.  As such, like most Star Trek games, it  can only really be recommended for Star Trek fans.Having said that, if  you're unfamiliar with the strategy genre, you will find this to be an  enjoyable enough starting point.  The graphics are great, the sounds lush,  the cinematics impressive, and the vocal talent appropriately star-filled.  For the novice to intermediate strategist, the game's AI and missions are  enough to occupy the senses as you get the idea of the genre.But, as has  been remarked before, if you *have* played strategy games before, it feels  like you're merely playing a buggy version of _Age of Empires_ in space.Despite having installed the first update patch, the game still quits  unexpectedly.  It also doesn't work very well at all with multiple-monitor  systems, failing to stop mouse movement at the edge of the playing screen.  In fact, the whole mouse movement is awkward.  After fiddling endlessly  with the mouse control option, it seems to me that there is just some kind  of small programming flaw; it doesn't scroll particularly smoothly,  regardless of setting.  It's not that the flaw is enough to make the game  unplayable, it's just that it's difficult sometimes to move with precision.  Which brings up another point:  perspective.  There's something about the  angle at which units and objects are placed that makes it difficult to see  as much of the playing field as you want at one time.  There's so much  empty space in the game, by definition, that, in order to see everything,  you really need to be 'pulled back' more than the game allows.Still,  there's hope that much of this will be solved by additional patches.  Clearly there's enthusiasm for the product amongst the Star Trek community,  and Activision has already serviced this community with one patch.  More  will undoubtedly be forthcoming, and the game might well work itself into  stability.Of course, the larger point is that _Starcraft_ and _Age of  Empires II_ (among others) are already stable, challenging, and popular  among multiplayer communities.

I wouldn't remotely qualify as one, and I still loved it. Anyone who appreciates a good RTS should already have this.More than being good strategy, Armada is also an excellent graphical experience. The ships fight with cinematic intensity, with realistic damage and attractive projectile action. You can even go to a 'movie mode' where you can view a melee from a floating 3-D perspective (although at the expense of control).On the strategy side, there is only one resource- dilithium. You harvest it from dilithium moons that can be finite or infinite. It's a pretty straightforward resource model, and things are automated enough that you won't have to micromanage it. A welcome balance tweak is the starbase armament, which makes a rush basically impossible. Bad news for all the battle.net fools that like to send zerglings or zealots (you know who you are). Each race has an superweapon of immense power, but in every case they are prohibitively expensive and slow to build. If you see one anywhere in the first 20 minutes of the game, someone is probably hacking. However, once someone gets one, they have a pretty major advantage against anyone that's technologically deficient. You can also make good of the potentially powerful- though also very physically weak- science vessels each race offers. They're expensive and slow, but can be the deciding factor in a major battle. All of this serves to make advancing your tech a very feasible strategy over a simple 'build more warships, wear them down' method.The single play campaign is excellent. It has a neat plot and you'll see a lot of unique starships that you won't see elsewhere- such as the two Cardassian types, Dominion vessels, and a Breen battleship. None of the levels are especially hard, but they can take some thinking. I especially liked one where you have to pilot USS Avenger to safety with a Klingon fleet hot on your tail.Multi-play is probably the weakest aspect of the game. It's choppy even on a direct connection and hunting down every last one of your enemies can be utterly tedious. Playing online also makes the game notoriously crash prone, and if you have eight people in one game it is both extremely slow and crashy. The computer plays a lot like the Dark Reign AI, building up until it has a huge force and then trying to swamp you. If you survive that one big assault, the computer is plenty ready to die. Rather than improving the AI to be a bit smarter, the difficulty settings give it a handicap- a very huge one on hardest. They build things faster and everything costs less, so they can send a bigger attack at you earlier in the game.Now, I know enough about Trek to realize that some of the ships aren't accurately specified. The Defiant, especially, is incredibly weak for something that could take and dish out so much damage in Deep Space Nine. Nevertheless, the actual sides are very well balanced and the models are so well done that the specifications are a minor point. Each side has its strengths and weaknesses. For example, all Romulan ships can cloak, but the Romulans are at a severe penalty when being boarded or trying to board ships of other races. There were a few balance problems with special weapons- such as the chain reaction pulsar- but they have been fixed in updates. The patch also (in my case at least) makes the game far more stable. Be sure you download it.All right, so the game has a few weaknesses, but other than that it is a huge load of fun. For strategy fans or Trekkies, this is a must-buy.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great real time strategy', 'unixReviewTime': 1005264000, 'reviewTime': '11 9, 2001'}
