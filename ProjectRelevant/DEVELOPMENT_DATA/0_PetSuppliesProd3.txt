(Imagine if all you and I ate were chips!) Because of this, I also feed my cats meaty canned food as well. I guess my point is that to avoid pet obesity, pets should have a well balanced diet just like the rest of us, and you can't hold the manufacturers of dry food responsible for that fact. Otherwise, it would be like blaming McDonalds for making you fat, don't you think?Anyway, what I DO know is that my cats love this dry food so much that they would actually rather have that then the meaty wet food. I know this because when I switched to Hill's Science Diet, my cats quit finishing the wet food that I set out for them. In fact, because of this, I'm probably going to pay more attention to the suggested serving sizes printed on bag, as opposed to just keeping their dishes full. Everything in moderation, right?The only reason I gave this product 4 starts instead of 5 is because of the abnormally high price. I'm willing to pay the extra for my little kitties, but that doesn't mean I have to be happy about it.So all in all, I highly recommend this product.
