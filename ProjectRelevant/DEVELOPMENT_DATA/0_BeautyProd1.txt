I've only been using it for a week, so I do not expect to see hair growth at this point.  It's good to note that I'm 42 years old, w/disturbing hair loss.The bottles are SMALL so I'm not using it carelessly. The smell is not flowery & fun, but it's more medicinal in scent, not overpowering. The shampoo lathers if you work at it, & it's a low lather rather than a high and luffy one. I rub it gently on my scalp & throughout my hair. If scrub too hard, I'll lose MORE HAIR. :( I am washing my hair every day, where I used to wash every other day. The conditioner does not lather.  It's more of a cream that I rub gently onto wet hair. My hair feels sort of weighty as I wash it & I think that I'm going to have a BAD HAIR DAY ahead of me, but after styling, it's actually soft, manageable, not weighty! After washing, I wrap in a towel for about 5 minutes, apply FINESSE styling mousse, let my brown curls air dry. Sometimes a touch of hairspray but most days, not. With the thick feel in the shower, I am surprised that it's not weighted down after styling. SO, I'll keep on trying this for 3 months. I'll try to remember to update if I see a difference. Feel free to ask me questions.**IT'S IMPORTANT TO MENTION THAT ALONG W/THE SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER, I'M TAKING, MAXI HAIR SUPPLEMENTS.  My Dr. was pleased w/the ingredients of the shamp, cond AND supplements. I use the supplements in place of a multi so I also take OMEGA 3 & Calcium Citrate w/ D3. (As per Dr).**6/27/2013 - Although there is NO new hair growth, I've noticed that I'M LOSING LESS HAIR when I wash & style!  It's enough for me to notice & enough for me to keep going w/ this trial. 19 days in, w/ consistent use of shamp/cond & Maxi Hair, my hair is smoother, softer, shinier stronger, doesn't have a bad smell, still not weighty & continues to be manageable. I feel like whatever residue was clogging my hair is out. My hope is that this is the case for my scalp & maybe, just maybe, I'll see some new sprouts. A girl can dream. :)6/30/2013 - Could it be?  New hair?  Will keep you posted.  I see three short hairs poking through!  I should also note that my nails need to be trimmed more often than ever, and I have to shave, (legs, underarms), more frequently!  I suspect this would be from the internal good I'm getting from the Maxi-Hair supplement.7/21/2013 - YES!  Still losing less hair, AND there IS new hair growth in little stray spots.  My nails, which I keep short, need to be cut once every week to 10 days as opposed to once every 3 or more weeks!  I rcvd two complements on my hair this past week, about how shiny &healthy; it looks!  I remain faithful to the products, using them EVERY DAY as recommended.9/21/13 - IMPORTANT UPDATE.  It seems that with months of use, this product is GREAT for clearing up any residue on my scalp, BUT it is drying out my hair.  I have to rotate my use of this and the conditioner.  It's stripping the oils from my hair.  I will still use the shampoo and conditioner, but may just use it once a week.  WIll keep updating.  I did notice that for the past two weeks, when I use the products, my scalp gets just a little itchy.  That also indicates to me that the residue blocking my pores may be cleared up!  That is the good part!  SO, I will be using the MAXI HAIR daily as bottle recommends, but will limit the use of the shampoo and conditioner.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Losing less hair!

I have now been using the combination of Biotin B shampoo and conditioner for about 2 months now.  I would also like to explain a little bit about my hair - I have medium shoulder length, straight hair.  I have very oily skin, which then gets my hair oily by the end of the day.  My scalp also gets very itchy, something I have attributed to an allergy in the "chemical" shampoos (I formerly used Artec by Loreal professional, Joico, and Matrix).  I also swim in a chlorinated pool on a fairly regular basis.Pros:organic - need I say more?gentle - I takes away my itch, and I have not had any other problems with dandruff or anything. The first ingredient listed is Aloe.So/So:smell  - not super yummy, but not intolerable eitherCons:Tangles!!!  No matter how much I use, the conditioner does not detangle my hair.  I let my hair dry, almost completely before I comb it (sometimes that\'s hard)Oil fields.  For some reason, this conditioner really makes my hair oily.  Before I even get out of the shower, my hair is so gluey, oily, and just not even nice.  I let it just dry that way, to see if it\'s only appearing oily while it\'s wet; nope.  It weighed down my hair, and it just wasn\'t as flowy and light.  To help, (I really wanted to give the combination a good go) I began not completely rinsing the shampoo out of my hair prior to adding the conditioner.  I would then completely rinse the shampoo and conditioner simultaneously.  This did alleviate a good chunk of the oil, but my hair still felt weighed down.Quantity to condition.  In order to get the conditioner to completely get to all of my hair, I had to use a ton!  It is really thick, and hard to spread throughout my hair.  I ended up running out of conditioner at the time that my shampoo was half empty.As far as "thickening" goes, I have noticed with using the combination of shampoo + conditioner, that my hair is not necessarily thicker, however, I have noticed that as I wash/condition my hair, less hair falls out during the showering process.  I used to have so much hair in the drain after a shower that my boyfriend used to joke, "how are you not bald by now?!?", but now I only loose maybe 7 or so hairs in the shower.  A MAJOR decrease.  With less hair falling out, I would certainly say that my hair is able to "thicken", not on an individual strand level, but overall my head of hair is thicker.Would I purchase again - yes/no.  I would purchase the shampoo again (I overall liked the way it cleaned, and made my scalp feel), but I would probably not purchase the conditioner again.

I had such high hopes, but in only two shampooings, my hair was noticeably stripped of oils, had that &#34;squeaky clean&#34; feeling you get when using a very harsh product, and it became dry and brittle. It started looking very dull. They use many products that have an oil stripping effect on the hair, like orange oil and lemon oil. You might think because it says, 'oil' that it might add to your hair's shine, but these are ingredients in industrial strength degreasers. This product only damaged my hair. Avalon is only 70% organic and it had a rather unpleasant smell to me. Rather like mosquito repellant or dish soap. Using a harsh product like this is very detrimental for your hair. I know that a lot of people will be drawn to Avalon because of the low price, but if it drastically stripped my extremely oily hair in two shampoos, I can't imagine what it might do to yours. Although my hair is very fine, so perhaps ethnic girls, and women with coarser hair might benefit? I honestly wouldn't recommend it. I'd rather see people get something that will improve their self-esteem immediately, rather than give them new problems to worry about.In desperation I purchased the more expensive Just Naturals system for thinning hair and believe me, it blows Avalon out of the water. In just one shampoo my hair regained it's texture and became so silky it felt like Asian hair. I can't stop touching my hair now and I feel so much more confident. They use incredible ingredients that greatly benefit people with hair loss due to hormonal issues, or who have an increase in DHT. You do pay more than double for that shampoo, but having something that supports your hair, improves the texture, and smells fantastic, was worth it to me. I'm now quite confident in what I'm using and plan to go on using it, regardless of the cost. I'd pay 5x what I'm paying for it now, I love it so much. And their treatment spray is oil based. I use the system twice a day and I'm shocked at how long it is lasting. It has truly been an excellent investment.I would recommend that you shampoo and condition your hair twice a day if you want to see regrowth with any system. This is because one application of shampoo with DHT-fighting ingredients, can only do so much. Your body is constantly generating new hormones and new DHT. By helping to combat it twice a day, you have a better chance of seeing results sooner. This is coming from a 36 year old woman who has been fighting repeated hair loss due to hormonal imbalance from 16 on. Once a day just never cut it for me. Using a leave on treatment like Just Naturals has overnight, can also work wonders. I use it during the day too if I'm not going out.I hope this helps you recover your hair, and your self-esteem, a little faster and more efficiently. :o)", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Industrial strength degreaser.

The smell is very similar to lemon Pledge or Lysol. When I first opened the conditioner, it was really a really thick and creamy appearance, but the second I put it in my hair, it lost all of its integrity and seemingly barely covered my hair! I usually start applying at my tips and slowly working my way up to about 4" away from my roots, but I was having such a hard time working it up that I had to reapply a couple times. What a waste of conditioner! When I rinsed it out, my hair had a dry and straw-ish consistency. Not very pleased. I do notice that my hair has grown a bit faster this past month or two. I\'m unsure if that\'s due to the Biotin supplements or the shampoo/conditioner. I just end up throwing a bunch of Dove brand leave-in conditioner because of the way this shamp/cond leaves my hair.', 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Biotin Thickening Conditioner', 'unixReviewTime': 1361318400, 'reviewTime': '02 20, 2013'}
