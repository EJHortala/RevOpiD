Its 18v pattery provides long lasting bright light for close objects.  It\'s "flexible snake" handle can be used to hang the light anywhere and aim it where needed. It would be an ideal light to hang under a open car hood to light up the engine compartment.However, after I received my DeWalt flexible floodhlight, I found on Amazon a black aluminum LED flashlight ("3 Watt Cree LED 3 AA Tactical Flashlight 180 Lumen Long Throwing Tight Spot yet wide moon light Torch, 7224bk") which uses 3 AA batteries and produces 180-200 lumens of light. A typical flashlight with an incondescant bulb will normally be WELL under 20 lumins, including the DeWalt flexible floodlight. At close objects it has a very small, bright center beam, but a very broad overspill beam allowing the user to view things not in the main beam very well. For illuminating distant objects, the small center beam gets broader with the distance from the object. It will illuminate objects 400-500 ft. away. I purchased the LED flashlight on Amazon and consider it to be one of the best flashlights I\'ve owned. The way that LED flashlights have improved (compared to incondescant bulbs) is amazing. I use 3 re-chargeable AA batteries in mine. They get 3-5 hours per charge. In about 6 months I\'ve only had to recharge it one time, and it gets lots of use.

Let\'s face it, you can\'t even figure out how to work a flex neck on a flashlight, so who really cares what you think!  Take a few seconds - straighten the flex portion fully upright, keep the weight of the head over the units center of gravity, flex/point from the top of the support and aim the light where you need it.  It will stay there just fine, at least till you move it, or some other moron knocks it over.

The DeWalt battery is always ready, it's easy to clip into the light, and it  provides a bright, clear beam.  If you have other DeWalt tools, this flashlight is a perfect complement.Tip: Spend a little extra and get the DeWalt XBR line of 18V batteries.

While it is combo filler, it is also very usefull, the flex is rigid and stays where you point it. At least sofar being only 2 weeks old. Bright enough to see, this is not a surefire. I even hung it from some pipes and it worked. I grab this light for more jobs that I ever thought I would.An multi LED version or better yet a combo LED/incandescent would be a good redesign for the nano version.
