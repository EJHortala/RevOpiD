By the time I was thirteen I was decorating cakes myself.  Paste food colors, which allow for very intense color without using a lot of product, have had a home in my kitchen for more than 50 years.  Often they have been Wilton colors. In years past when I was doing lots of cake decorating I usually bought 1 ounce or even 4 ounce jars of color, but even a 1 ounce jar is far more than you need for the limited use of home baking.The half-ounce jars inWilton 601-5580 1/2-Ounce Certified-Kosher Icing Colors, Set of 12offer enough color to easily last a year or more, even allowing for dyeing your Easter eggs.  Do remember that a tiny bit of this goes a very, very long way and that it will stain your hands & counter.  I find it best to remove only a small part of the inner seal and then use a toothpick to remove just the tiniest bit of color at a time.  (You can always add more for deeper color.)A couple of notes - Frosting colored with paste color deepens in color as it stands.  You won\'t notice this much with pastel colors but it is readily apparent with bright red, blue and green.  Roses the exact red of red roses when you make them will dry a very deep maroon. Also, very deep colors that require a substantial amount of color to achieve usually will have an "off" taste from so much color.How to Dye Eggs with Paste Color -This will give you true red, purple, bright blue and other brilliantly hued eggs.Put about 1/3-1/2 teaspoon of paste color in the bottom of a cup or mug.  (I like to use cups with light colored interiors.)  Add 1 teaspoon of white or cider vinegar, then fill the cup to about 1.5 inches from the top with boiling water.  Stir to dissolve.  Soak hard boiled eggs in the color solution until you get the shade you want.

I\'ve used it with granulated sugar and with sparkling sugar (bigger crystals) and it works great either way, but the sparkling sugar is more, well, "sparkly" which I like since I use the colored sugar to decorate cakes and cookies with.  Put the sugar into a Ziploc bag, take the tip of a butter knife to get some color on it, then wipe the color off the knife on the inside of the bag. (Does that make sense?)  Zip up the bag, then mash the sugar around with the color until evenly distributed.  The color will come off the side of the plastic bag just fine and blend in with the sugar.
