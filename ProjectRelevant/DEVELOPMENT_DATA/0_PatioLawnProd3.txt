The only thing I wish this heat tape had was a remote sensing device that would tell me in the house if the heat tape failed to come on when the pipe temperature goes below 38 degrees. The light inside the plug only is visible if you get in the crawl space where the pipe is and, even then, it only tells you if the outlet has power. If the thermostat on the heating unit goes bad, your pipes could freeze even if the light inside the transparent plug is on. I would be willing to pay a little extra for this peace of mind. Frozen pipes and possible consequent water damage to floors and insulation which would invite mold later on is certainly enough reason to know exactly when your pipes are at risk of freezing so you can turn on your water to prevent freezing while you obtained a heat tape replacement.I may have to rig a simple coil that senses current flowing through the heat tape and sends the "we have current" message through wires to a meter along with a remote temperature sensor for now.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'All it needs is remote sensing', 'unixReviewTime': 1325376000, 'reviewTime': '01 1, 2012'}

First, it says to wrap the pipe in aluminum foil if installing on plastic pipe (I didn\'t do this since the pipe is black and I figure it\'ll absorb heat just fine).  Next, the cable has to be secured to the pipe every 6 inches with electrical tape rated at least 80C.  After that, you\'re supposed to wrap it in up to 1/2" fiberglass pipe insulation.  Finally, you wrap the insulation in waterproofing material.  I ended up needing a little under 50 feet of 1/2" fiberglass insulation wrap to wrap 12 feet of 1.5" pipe with 2 90 degree elbows and 2 large shut off valaves.  The insulation was about $7 at Lowes and included plastic wrap to waterproof it.
