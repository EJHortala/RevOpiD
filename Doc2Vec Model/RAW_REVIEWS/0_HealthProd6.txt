In addition to the reason that made me an inpatient, I had developed quite a red, itchy rash "down there."  The (male) nurse gave me a little dose-cup of cream and a wooden coffee stick and suggested I apply it to myself after showering.  Recognizing the familiar smell and thickness of the cream as some version of Monistat, I asked, "Why this?  I don\'t have a vagina."  The nurse, who was not easily shocked, replied "Similar condition.  Hot, wet, anaerobic (oxygen-free).  Just use it."I did, and it worked--to a point.  But why, I asked myself, hadn\'t someone thought of taking one of the many athletic powders on the market and making Miconazole Nitrate (as in Monistat) its active ingredient?  That would combine a proven antifungal agent with the dryness and absorbent quality of an athletic powder. Several years later I was delighted to find this Zeabsorb type AF on drugstore shelves, and it has been a mainstay for my torrid zone every since.It\'s a simple combination but it works well for me: the powder dries, and the Miconazole Nitrate fights fungus.  It works great against my crotch rotch or any impending versions thereof.  It also keeps my summer armpits from getting "withery," if you should be annoyed by that condition.  Since it is a fine enough powder to fight friction, it is refreshing and comfortable on the guy bits themselves, especially worn with summer cotton. Personally, it\'s just okay on my feet, not much better than original Desenex or even Gold Bond green label, but for simplicity\'s sake it has become my all-over, take-with powder. (Note that it is marketed as a remedy against athlete\'s foot.)  Be sure, when you buy this, to look for the wasp-waisted plastic bottle with the green strip in the middle; other reviewers have stressed that similar-looking products don\'t work as well.  Not everyone will warm to the smell, which is basically locker-room medicinal, slightly sweet.  Certainly it has the advantages of not smelling of kid stuff like baby powders, nor like menthol, but not SO macho people can smell you half a block away.  "Get me some of that s--- that don\'t stink," said Kevin Costner\'s baseball player in the movie BULL DURHAM, and perhaps he had something like Zeabsorb in mind.Typically, Zeabsorb AF is not cheap, with a price at the premium end of mass-distribution powders.  I ordered the two-pack for sale here at Amazon, for a savings of about 25 percent per bottle compared to my local Walmart, roughly 40 percent less than at Walgreen\'s.  The bottles were shrink-wrapped together, put in a clear protective bag, and then boxed with air bladders--flawless.  I am sorry some reviewers here had problems with different versions of Zeabsorb than they bargained for, or poor packaging; hopefully those problems have been addressed.  Certainly I am pleased with my experience.  Also, thus far, this is NOT an add-on item, a plus with me.If you haven\'t tried Zeabsorb AF yet, I recommend it, but I do realize the choice of an antifungal powder like this is somewhat subjective.  Personally, I know of no good substitute for the powder for personal use, and the price at Amazon as of now can\'t be beat.

At first I don\'t really care about its existence as I think it would go away eventually. However that\'s not the case, in fact, the affected areas are getting bigger and the itchiness is killing me! I\'d say I have the what some of you might call "advanced jock itch". I believe that\'s the case too because the affected area is as big as my palm or maybe even bigger!Having to conclude that this disease is not a typical one that would just go away by itself, I tried the Pedifix FungaSoapLiquid with tea tree oil but that did not work for me. I\'d like it to work but it did not. Having the advanced jock itch is never a good thing. It\'s embarrassing! I finished the whole bottle but it did not seem to do anything. It did reduce the itchiness but that was it. I\'m not really fond of the cream product because I find it uncomfortable to walk/work when the affected areas are all "greasy".so I decided to try this product after reading the many positive reviews. I bought the one with 2 packs. I am a very happy customer! I\'m into my 1 week using this product & already all the itchiness & cracking of the affected skin area are gone! I\'m so happy with the result! I am planning to use up the 2 packs just to make sure it won\'t come back.Just keep in mind to take a shower at least twice daily, use a new towel each time, use new boxers/undies each time too. Minimize workouts or any activities that will result in sweating especially around the affected areas. I apply the powder at least 3 times daily, after each shower & 1 before going to bed.The result may vary with individuals though, just like the Pedifix with tea tree oil able to cure some folks, I find this product to cure mine. Some folks does not like the scent of the powder but that does not bother me because it\'s not too overpowering. Plus I don\'t really care about the smell as long as I can cure this embarrassing illness.This product works for me so I highly recommend it.**updateI\'ve been using this product well over 3 weeks now & my jock itch is now gone!

Like most people, I didn\'t know what this was at first and wrote it off as a chafe rash -  very common when you run 20 miles a week.  When the small brownish patch with raised red edges grew from the size of a dime to a quarter with a dry, scaly covering, I knew it was something else.  Being a very hygienic person, I was horrified when I learned it was a fungus.  And I still don\'t know how I came in contact with it.So I started with the antifungal creams.  One butenafine hydrochloride based, and another clotrimazole based.  I applied them religiously for 3 days, 3 times a day and they did absolutely nothing.  They didn\'t make it any worse but I saw zero improvement.  And although the instructions say you need to use these for up to 2 weeks, I need to see some change to know the product is actually working and the rash isn\'t just going away on its own.  Strike one.Next up was the "organic" route.  I tried tea tree oil with mixed results.  First off, this stuff is incredibly strong.  You NEED to do a patch test on a healthy part of skin to verify you don\'t have an adverse reaction to it.  I did this and had no reaction.  Still, when I applied it, diluted, to the affected area, I would experience some pretty intense burning.  I wrote this off as the oil just doing its thing but after 3 days, I had to call it quits.  I think the tea tree oil did help kill off the fungus, but it left the whole area pink, irritated, and with skin peeling off.  Strike two (kinda).After a frantic search for powder based cures, enter Zeastrom AF.  This stuff kicked butt.  After 24 hours, the peeling and most of the irritation went away.  Now, 48 hours later, I\'m seeing the patch fading and returning to normal looking skin.  Thank you makers of Zeastrom!  And this makes sense that this would work.
