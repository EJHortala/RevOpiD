Anyone who expects fast weight loss, has not read the articles on CLA. I bought this product mainly for two reasons: (1) I read "The Cure for Heart Disease" (a great book, by the way) and the cardiologist who wrote it recommended CLA because it can reduce inflammation in the body, lead to a better proportion of lean body mass to fat in the body, lead to a better balance of blood fats which can affect heart and blood vessel health, and lead to - very slow however - weight loss. I do not need to lose weight but I do want to lose body fat, as I am "skinny fat" and while I exercise daily to work towards this goal, I can use a little help from this CLA product. Also with heart disease history in my family, this supplement makes sense for that reason. I have tried another brand of CLA however that other brand, really upset my stomach, even though it was 1000mg and therefore less than this product. The Natrol CLA at 1200 mg does not bother my stomach at all and I am very happy with it. I am here at amazon to buy my 2nd bottle. The price is also terrific.

I got several large acne cysts on my chin and wondered what in the world was going on. It was the first time I ever had to go to a dermatologist for acne. She said it was caused by hormones. Over two visits, I had to get 7 anti-inflammatory shots in my face, and the doc wanted to prescribe an oral antibiotic because she said I had an infection. I chose an antibiotic cream instead. The cream would slide around on my face at night and burn my lips so I couldn't sleep! Not to mention my chin was red and inflamed and oozed three different colors. Go me. So I stopped taking the CLA supplement.Then a couple weeks later, I thought I would take the supplement again to see if it really was the CLA that caused the acne, and another large cyst grew on my forehead. It got bigger and bigger and eventually my skin stretched into a point. I had a small horn on my head. I was finally a unicorn! Then it erupted like a volcano. Yep, that ended my trial of CLA.But wait, there's more! CLA also messed with my monthly cycle.

{'reviewerID': 'A1JE7PUM5I3R5F', 'asin': 'B00005317T', 'reviewerName': 'ilovewoofy', 'helpful': [6, 11], 'reviewText': "***EDIT****  this edit is written over a week after the original review, my original review had been very positive as I had noticed a quick response after taking this and seemed to notice fat loss and increased metabolism. However, after a week of taking this I noticed increased fat gain mostly in my stomach where I never gain weight which has been quite hard to lose. I've also noticed that the side effects of increased temperature went away after s few days. I heard that cla only works if lifting weights or exerciseing heavily otherwise the acid turns into fat. I stopped taking it and am working on ridding of the excess stomach fat it gave me. Im currently trying cayenne pepper to speed up my metabolism which so far seems to be working.Note**I did NOT buy CLA Tonalin on amazon, I bought it in the grocery store (Hannaford) for about ten dollars but before I even got to the cashier, I was on my smart phone looking up the product on amazon to see how its rated. I trust the reviews on here so I decided I'd make my own.Also**I am not overweight but I have gained ten pounds since the semester started at college. I could blame it on the beer or pizza but the only reasons I was indulging in those things was because I had gone through a very stressful event right before fall semester started and stress apparently makes me overeat all the wrong foods. I usually am extremely healthy and eat a gluten free, paleo diet.My weight was relatively stable in November (and no still not overweight, just a much curvier version of myself). Then of course another extremely event had to occur right before final exams, by that point I given up the unhealthy lifestyle but still found myself over eating purely out of stress. I also never slept, I wouldn't fall asleep until past midnight, would have to get up at 5:30 am for school and then nap during the day. I was always tired and had headaches and stressed and anxious, and my sleep schedule and stress could add on weight, but eating too much on top of that made me gain weight like crazy. After gaining 4 pounds in a week I freaked out, I had to do something different, I couldn't stand all of the excess fat, I could barely squeeze into my jeans! I still wasn't overweight but I definitely wasn't considered tiny like I used to be! So I started working out more (not really but going from like one day to two days working out) and tried very hard to eat less and de-stress during the day. I picked the CLA up while trying healthier habits and have noticed a big difference in fat loss. I gain weight mostly in my hip area and used to never have fat around my stomach so its very easy for me to tell if I'm gaining or losing weight just by looking at my stomach and how much I can grab. (Ten pounds ago I couldn't grab anything). Well when I was at my heaviest I could grab quite a bit, around my bellybutton and my sides. This has decreased by about half. Also, my hips have a little less fat. And I had just picked up the CLA three days ago! Now you could say, well this could be due to the increased exercise or eating less before taking the CLA and I agree, it could be. So I'm only giving it 4 stars for now and I'm going to come back and rate again. (Though, my sleep schedule has NOT changed).However, there are things I have noticed immediately from these pills besides fat loss:-Increased temperature. I'm ALWAYS cold plus I live in the second most northern state in the U.S. and its in the teens here. I've gotten to the point where three hours or so after I've taken a pill I have to go outside to cool down when my roommates are huddled in their electric blankets.-I'm starving. Again, this is the same time frame as when I notice a dramatic increase in temperature (about 3 hours after taking the pill). I feel like a teenage boy, I can't stop eating, and its not sugary fatty foods I crave like when I'm stressed, its high carb foods, the quickest thing to fill me up, flavor not mattering. I've been eating WAY more than usual from taking these pills. I used to only be able to eat toast in the morning, never for dinner or I'd gain weight ( I love toast lol) but now I can eat 2 slices at night (40 carbs) plus potatoes and squash and soup and chicken and a whole bag of light buttered popcorn and hot cocoa and lemonade and a granola bar and coconut ice cream and not gain weight, which is pretty amazing, since before, I would only the vegetables and chicken and maybe 1/3 a bag of popcorn and hot cocoa and not gain weight.My schedule with CLA:*Breakfast: (6 am):  I eat 3-4 slices of gluten free toast, greek yogurt, two cups of coffee. I do NOT take CLA, I figure my metabolism is highest in the morning and its not going to do much.*Lunch #1: (11 am): I have a spinach and fruit smoothie made with rice milk instead of fruit juice and only a little bit of yogurt. I do NOT take the CLA since the smoothie is really healthy compared to the rest of my meals.*Lunch #2: (1 pm): Full serving of Stir-fry with brown rice, light soy sauce, shrimp, and vegetables. I DO take a CLA at this point.*Dinner #1: (4 pm): Chicken, vegetables with light butter. I do NOT take a CLA.*Dinner #2: (7 pm): Chicken, vegetables with light butter, orange, hot cocoa, usually 20 min later..this is when cravings kick in. I DO take a CLA.*Dessert/Snack: (8:30-9 pm): Organic Popcorn, another hot cocoa, oranges, sometimes a granola bar or coconut ice cream. I DO take a CLA.So Overall, I eat like a hobbit. (throughout the day). So I can't base it off the whole three meals a day thing but I do only take it 3 times a day. I take it with meals, usually later in the afternoon/night when my metabolism is lower. I also take it right after I finished my plate with ALOT of water.When I used to eat this much, I was gaining weight if I didn't work out. Now I eat this much and I've barely increased my exercise regime, which is not intense, more weight training/resistance than anything, not much cardio at all.I'm going to give it another week before I reply again.But what you should take out of this review so far is that I'm young, healthy, not overweight, don't eat really unhealthy foods, but I'm used to being in a certain 5 lb range than I'm out of. My increased weight was due to stress. The CLA seems to dramatically increase my temperature (could be a direct correlation to metabolism?) as well as my hunger levels but decreases my cravings. I still have cravings but there very mild, I used to want to devour chocolate bars and cupcakes all the time ( I didn't but I wanted to) whereas now, a hot cocoa suffices to curb my cravings.", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'works at. first then adds fat may work if lifting', 'unixReviewTime': 1386547200, 'reviewTime': '12 9, 2013'}

Almost to full after only having so much of a meal but I guess it helps with hunger control and appetite.

This one takes the cake with its serving size (1200mg) and its price compared to similar products I've used.  Since I started using CLA as a supplement over a year ago, I noticed more definition in my abdominal area.  This could just be a placebo effect, or attributed to my physical fitness regimen (free weights and cardio), and use of other supplements (creatine, whey protein, etc.).There are a few reviews here, where customers are bashing this product for lack of short-term results (i.e. they aren't happy because they haven't lost significant weight after using one bottle).  These customers need to keep in mind that this is a nutritional supplement, and not a FDA-approved drug, treatment, or cure all.  If you read up on CLA on various websites (WebMD, Wikipedia, websites that cite peer-reviewed articles/scientific research), you'll find that there are suggested correlations between CLA usage and 1) the reduction of body fat and increase in lean body mass, and 2) the reduction and/or hindrance of the growth of tumors.  Correlation does not mean causation, however, and that's why there's continuous research into CLA.Think of CLA like any nutritional supplement: It'll help you get to where you want to be, but you have to take steps towards getting there yourself.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great for its price', 'unixReviewTime': 1298937600, 'reviewTime': '03 1, 2011'}
