The longer pin is the same length as the ones from the yellow plastic holders.  The other pin is about a 1/4 of an inch shorter.  The important thing here is that the OXO holder holds the cob very well so my opinion is the pins are sized correctly.  Another complaint was the black handle started to dissolve and get sticky after 5 years.  I can't address that yet as I have had them less than a year.  Just in case, I only hand wash them to avoid any high heat that might damage the plastic (rubber?).  Also don't plan to use any harsh cleaning solutions that might damage the black material.

Thats the kind of question you want to ask yourself before you buy corn grips.  These have a thick handle and wide stabbers.  The wide stabbers are great for securely holding the corn, but the wide/thick handles present challenges if you have corn dishes that have a narrow part on the ends.  Traditional corn grips are thinner and fit in these smaller ends of the dishes much easier.  However, with a thick handle like these, they will not sit in the thin edges of my corn dishes.  This results in the corn not making contact with the bottom of the dish, because the grip handles are sitting on top of the narrow ends of the dish.  So if you like to lather on butter and seasoning, be aware that if your corn dishes have narrow ends, you will not be able to roll your corn around in the bottom of the dish.

These corn holders dont slip like those cheap yellow ones that look like ears of corn.  Also, I have managed to break a few of those cheap yellow corn holders when trying to push them into an ear of corn.  Not a good thing when your hands are slippery from butter.
