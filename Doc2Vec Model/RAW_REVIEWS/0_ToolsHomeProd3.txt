I've had this light hanging around for a couple of years from a combo set. It actually works well enough, though I don't often need a worklight. We recently had a 4 day power outage and this was great while it lasted both as a very bright flashlight, and to point at the ceiling to give some nice general non-glare room illumination.It only lasts about two hours on a charge is the problem. If anything screams out for an LED bulb, this is it, but at this point DeWalt doesn't even offer that as a separate bulb. They do sell a 12V LED worklight which sounds just awesome, but I don't have the 12V system, I have the 18V. With an LED this would never burn out the bulb. This one will last maybe 10-15 hours which is not what you want in an emergency light with no spare. Also if you drop this light the bulb filament will probably break, LED's are much more robust. Moreover, with the same brightness it would go probably 8-12 hours on a charge or more. That would be pretty much my essential emergency light. I would buy two or three.Though the gooseneck probably looks like the better design. What really kills this is that the head ought to swivel so it could point downwards while standing upright on the battery base. You could work at a table or workbench with the light pointed at your work. But this only swivels from straight up to horizontal, which is really not all that useful.In short, wait for them to offer the gooseneck with an LED, and get two, it will be super.", 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Screams out for an LED bulb option', 'unixReviewTime': 1322956800, 'reviewTime': '12 4, 2011'}

Purchased it because I have five or six other DeWalt 18v tools and a couple batteries, and they are all outstanding quality.The light delivered to me has the smaller footprint (for lithium batteries), though my toolset still is based on NiCd batteries and chargers. That was not a problem as it still fits nicely on the NiCd battery... matter of fact, I think that the bigger NiCd battery probably gives this light a much more stable base than a smaller battery would.  Does make it a bit heavy to carry around though, so this light stays in the shop and does not hit the trail with us.The light works well and the position selector for the rotating head makes it easier for me to get the light to shine on just the right place that I need it to.  Similar to comments in other reviews, I was a bit surprised by the lack of intensity of the light though -- it might be just a tad brighter than your typical 2-D cell non-LCD flashlight.  Maybe I have become spoiled by all of the CREE LCDs flooding the market these days, but I did expect a brighter, whiter light.On the flip side, this light's reflection will not blind you when under the car working. It puts out just the amount of light needed, and the swivel head helps direct things nicely. Looks like some reviewers got the spare bulbs with theirs, and some did not... we were on the 'did not' side of things, but that is OK. Already have a couple spares order and sitting in my shopping cart waiting for me to checkout.If you are looking for a good, sturdy flashlight head to run on your Dewalt 18v batteries, this one will work. It is not the brightest or the lightest on the market, but the price and utility are right.
