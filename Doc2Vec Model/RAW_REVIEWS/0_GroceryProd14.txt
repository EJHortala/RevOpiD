Because I can\'t give up my favorite snack, I bought this Wabash Famnily Farms Amish Country popcorn.  The kernels are tiny, but they pop well, although not as big and fluffy as the popcorn I get from the grocery store.  It tastes great, however, and has fewer and smaller hulls.  I don\'t think there is such a thing as completely hulless,but Ido notice thst I don\'t get the hulls stuck in my teeth anymore.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Very good popocorn', 'unixReviewTime': 1308528000, 'reviewTime': '06 20, 2011'}
