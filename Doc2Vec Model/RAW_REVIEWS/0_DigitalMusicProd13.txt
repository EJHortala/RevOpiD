Elton put out several LPs a year during the early/mid 1970s, and they were all gems. Picking out a "Best Of" package would have required at least 3 discs, so MCA opted for a "Greatest Hits" thing instead.There isn\'t a weak track on this LP. Personally I\'ll always have a soft spot for "Crocodile Rock" and "Your Song," but I wouldn\'t get rid of anything here. Like the Beatles, Elton knows how to put across rockers and ballads, is open to new instrumentation and rhythms, and knows how to write a hook.I think the Elton influence on my generation has somehow been overlooked, even after the millions of albums and singles he sold.

I feel like sometime I am the only one that knows his music so very well, which is totally not true at all. This Man\'s music has been a part of my Life for many great & hard & sad times.And over the years. I own everything he has ever made. There are 3-songs that Elton has made that really has been a real serious part of my Life. The song "Levon\' and along with \'Someone save my life tonight\'. and my greatest \'Don\'t let the sun go down on me\' as to which these songs have played a vital role into my life. They were especially played often in the air during my college days, in a small town in Texas. These songs were songs that really gave me a chance to look at life as a whole, being away from home from the very first time. They really took a toll on me in a very strange way in a moment of sadness and feeling down,and they helped me in some ways. However this CD was a vital part in the days of college. I call it now the TJC story. This one CD here was a great CD I played it to death. Over a course of semesters I had to buy it several times due to the fact of it got lost one time, and stolen another time misplaced...But still today after 35-years I still have this CD, It is just wonderful...great music and so much truth in all of Elton\'s songs. As I ride up the Hiway sometimes I play this CD, sometimes I cannot listen to it, Because it reminds me of my college days, and water starts to run down my face. "ELTON" does not have a clue, as to what a role his music has played in my Life. I was very blessed to see him in concert in the 80\'s in Germany stationed there as a soldier for 5-1/2 years.It should almost be against the law for someone to produce such great music. He is very talented and a very smart man, when he come to music. Of course I don\'t know him personally I just bet he is a smart man period. But I promise you. You cannot go wrong when you buy this CD. In fact you cannot go wrong listening to Elton John period. I would be willing to bet that there are hundreds of people that will agree with me 400% plus. About 17-years ago I was in a grocery store late one night, I am talking about 03:30 in the morning to buy some things, And the store music system was playing Elton John, as to which I was overly shocked to death. Because we all know what kind of music, that you hear in a department store or the grocery store...However they played more than one song. They kept playing Elton John. As I left the store and got into my car. I thought to myself I am going to go back in there and ask the store manager is that a CD of some sound system radio set-up you are playing. And I did that, and he told me, that Yes!! that is old "Elton\' and he said  we play alot of the 70\'s music late over into the night early mornings. That is when I found out about Elton\'s John CD called Love songs. And the very next day I went and purchased it. As you can see I love \'Elton John\'. His Music is AWESOME! all of it. It is so much more I want to express about Elton Johns music,but I will close by saying If you are looking for great music, Elton John does it very well.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'The Best of them all', 'unixReviewTime': 1302825600, 'reviewTime': '04 15, 2011'}

His first compilation, 1974's 'Greatest Hits,' is by a long shot his best.I own a rare out-of-print version. The one I own is the original vinyl version. That one drops 'Candle Of The Wind' and has the other 10 songs. But I do know the song well, so that's not a problem (for me).This set spans 'Elton John' to 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.' Surprisingly, 'Tumbleweed Connection' and 'Madman Across The Water,' two of his most popular records of the early 1970s, do not get any representation here, which hurts the compilation a little bit.'Tiny Dancer,' 'Levon,' 'Burn Down The Mission' and 'Take Me To The Pilot' (from 11/17/70) all would fit nicely here.But, what's here is excellent. 'Your Song,' 'Daniel,' 'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,' 'Rocket Man,' 'Honky Cat,' and 'Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me' all appear here. And, those are my favorite Elton songs, so it works out perfectly!If you are a fan of the legendary early sides of Elton John, than this set is a perfect set to own.

{'reviewerID': 'A2NQUGGYM0DBM1', 'asin': 'B000001DVP', 'reviewerName': 'L.A. Scene', 'helpful': [7, 9], 'reviewText': 'Elton John has certainly cemented his place in the history of music.  He is a legendary performer who has rode a wave of success unlike any artist.  Elton John first came on the music scene in 1969.  Once his 1970 hit "Your Song" of his self titled "Elton John" (his second) album was released, it would begin one of the most consistent music careers in the history of music.  In fact, from 1969 until 1991 - there wasn\'t a calendar year that passed without the release of some sort of Elton John album.  Even after that, Elton would only miss 2 calendar years without a release between 1991 and 2004 (those years being 1998 and 2003).  On the plus side, not only has this given Elton John a level of consistency that has been unsurpassed, but it also has allowed him to build up an incredibly large music library.  There is a minus side:  With such frequent album releases, Elton\'s albums are often diluted.  While there have been dozens of legendary tracks by Elton John, there aren\'t too many "complete" Elton albums that I would dub of legendary status.  In other words, his albums usually contain 1 to 2 great tracks with the remainder of the tracks being lukewarm at best.  It is this scenario that makes a Greatest Hits album very attractive to the Elton John fan - namely because it allows one to have a collection of those legendary tracks in one place.  One such collection is the first Greatest Hits collection that Elton released entitled "Elton John Greatest Hits".Elton has certainly no shortage of Greatest Hits albums as he has released several of them.  There is this collection - "Greatest Hits", but there is also "Greatest Hits Volume 2", "Greatest Hits Volume III" (this one is a tough find), "Greatest Hits 1976-1986", and "Greatest Hits 1970-2002".  Other compilations include: "To Be Continued" Boxed Set and "Love Songs" collections.  "Elton John Greatest Hits" focuses on the early part of Elton\'s career - 1969 - 1974.  It is worth noting that all of the songs that are contained on this collection are also found on the "To Be Continued"  Boxed Set (although "Don\'t Let the Sun Go Down on Me" and "Candle in the Wind" are live versions on the boxed set).  With the exception of "Border Song", all of these songs are found on the "Greatest Hits 1970-2002" set.  The good thing is that "Greatest Hits" focuses on that early period in Elton\'s career - and this makes it a very attractive collection to have these songs.  However, I would still be tempted to go for one of the two broader collections - either "Greatest Hits 1970-2002" or "To Be Continued" despite some of the minor differences.For "Greatest Hits", there are 11 songs taken from 5 Elton John albums. For 1974, this is a pretty good sized collection of music to be available on a single album (This was before the days of CDs that could fit more music on a single unit).  These albums are: "Elton John" ("Your Song", "Border Song");  "Honky Chateau" ("Honky Cat", "Rocket Man"); "Don\'t Shoot Me I\'m Only the Piano Player" ("Daniel", "Crocodile Rock"); "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" ("Candle in the Wind", "Bennie and the Jets", "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road", "Saturday Night\'s Alright For Fighting"); Caribou ("Don\'t Let the Sun Go Down on Me").  As you can see, the pattern with Elton John not having depth on his albums seems to apply - except for the case of "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" (but this had 17 tracks - more than most albums during that time).Looking at the time period of 1969 through 1974, there are some glaring omissions of songs.  For starters, there are no tracks from Elton debut "Empty Sky".  "Empty Sky" might not be a well-known Elton John album, but there are other more obvious omissions.  There are no songs taken from the better known albums such as "Tumbleweed Collection" (namely "Burn Down the Mission") and "Madman Across the Water" ("Tiny Dancer" and "Levon").  Also missing from "Caribou" is the popular track "The Bitch is Back".  Much of these omissions go back to the fact that Elton probably wanted to put out a Greatest Hits album as a single entity.  As a result, just two years later Elton would release another Greatest Hits album entitled "Elton John Greatest Hits Volume 2".  This second collection would include some of the tunes that were omitted from this collection - namely "Levon" and "The Bitch is Back".  However, the omissions of "Burn Down the Mission" and "Tiny Dancer" are too much to overcome.  I consider these two of the best Elton John songs he has ever done.  While I do realize songs like "Daniel", "Honky Cat", and "Crocodile Rock" are close to the hearts of Elton John fans, I would have easily traded any of these songs to have those two omitted songs to be included.I\'m also disappointed the collection is not in chronological order of the release of the songs.  The reason I prefer this is because it allows me to see how the artist progresses over time.  The songs seemed to be "mixed" in an order for some reason, but I haven\'t been able to decipher what the logic was behind this particular ordering.The liner notes do contain some information, but not a lot.  For each of the tracks, each of the musician credits are included along with a couple of production credits.  They also tell the dates the songs were recorded, but they don\'t tell the album that the song was contained on.  As with most Greatest Hits collections, there are no lyrics included with this collection.  Even with some of the flaws, this was a good collection during its time.  However with some of the more recent releases, if you are a serious of casual Elton John fan, you are probably going to want to consider some of the more complete collections.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': "Elton's Early Work: Date and By No Means Complete", 'unixReviewTime': 1110499200, 'reviewTime': '03 11, 2005'}

Sherwin', 'helpful': [2, 2], 'reviewText': 'This CD of Elton John\'s "Greatest Hits" proves that Elton John is one of the very few Godfathers in the world of music. Even decades later these songs are great songs; he still performs "Saturday Night\'s Alright For Fighting" at many of his concerts even today.While I agree with the reviewer who writes that some albums are not represented on this CD, I nevertheless believe that this CD is still very strong and entertaining. It starts out beautifully with an especially tender ballad entitled "Your Song;" and it continues with "Daniel," another ballad about the singer\'s affection for a man who has left him at least for now. Other great classics on this CD include "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road" which tells the story of a man who wants something more than living an unhappy life with a rich partner; the ode to Marilyn Monroe entitled "Candle In The Wind;" and the bittersweet memories of a long gone youthful romance in the song "Crocodile Rock." The musical arrangements are all very well done; the rock and roll flavor mixed with a certain pop feel work incredibly well to produce powerful songs with lyrics and melodies that you will find hard to ever forget.The liner notes offer song credits and the date and place where each song was recorded. There\'s a picture of Elton--without his usual over-the-top attire--and the other picture of his band mates is great, too.Overall, I highly recommend this CD for Elton John fans, fans of pop-rock, and for people who want to get better acquainted with Elton John\'s earlier work.

It seems to be more like it is manufactured, than authentic. For artists of the past, they definitely have more of a true blue feeling of what was good music of the 70's. Elton John really is one those performers, who still knows how to continue, and definitively perform some great pop songs that still withstand the testiments of time. Although many of his records today, don't have a lot of appeal, his music still brings out the most to generations of all, and that has also been shown in his hits collections as well.Elton John Greatest Hits, is a reflection of Elton's best songs from the early to mid 1970's, and what made that standout sound still last today. The compilation includes a whole lot of Elton's best tracks from records like Caribou, Don't Shoot Me I'm The Piano Player, Madman Across The Water, Goodbye Yellow Brick Road, and Honky Chateau.

True, there are some big omissions here, but realize three things:1. This was originally an LP, so you couldn't fit eighty minutes of music on one record.2. Many of those omissions were put on the second collection of hits, which is also a good listen!3. Adding more songs would be taking a risk of disappointing fans who think the new additions were inferior to the original eleven here (even if most of his early work is great.)Keep that in mind. I judge albums by what's on them, not what's left off!1. Your Song: Quiet, refined, and easy listening. An instant and early classic that is still one of his best to this date. 10 out of 10.2. Daniel: More feel-good easy listening. Althoug I was never wild about this song, I enjoy it whenever it is played. Dig those guitars and that beat! 8.5 out of 10.3. Honky Cat: It all depends upon my mood on this faster-paced track. A banjo and horns never sounded this good with piano! 8.5 out of 10.4. Goodbye Yellow Brick Road: Much like Your Song, this song is a soft pop masterpiece. One of the highlights of the album with the same name. 9 out of 10.5. Saturday Night's Alright For Fighting: A rapid-fire barrage of electric guitar and piano. The riffs are some of the best and most catchy in all of rock history. My favorite Elton John song. 10 out of 10.6. Rocket Man: Sci-fi premise, superb song. The lyrics are out of this world (pardon the pun) and Elton's performance is awe-inspiring. 9.5 out of 10.7. Bennie And The Jets: The tricky beat and wacky lyrics only make this song better, and it already was top notch! An instant classic! 9.5 out of 10.8. Candle In The Wind: Elton made some great slow songs and this memorable song is no exception. Standard Elton. 8.5 out of 10.9. Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me: More pop perfection. Elton pulls off an emotional performance and Taupin's lyrics are on the money. A legendary hit. 9.5 out of 10.10. Border Song: The most curious addition here. It's not that it's subpar, because it is a grat song, but it seems a bit out of place for some unexplained reason. A great song nonetheless. 8.5 out of 10.11. Crocodile Rock: An Elton John radio staple still in play often on soft rock and classic rock radio stations. Much more free-spirited than the rest, but you can't help but like it! A perfect way to end an awesome collection! 9 out of 10.Overall: 9.5 out of 10. Short but sweet collection of classics.

His early success was so heady that MCA Records threw this quickie greatest hits on the public in the 1974 holiday season...when I received it as a Christmas gift with a new GE stereo player from my parents. This may be one of the albums that codified my tastes in music, along with "With the Beatles," "School\'s Out," "Can\'t Buy A Thrill" and "My Aim Is True."But in high school circa the early 70\'s, it was all about Elton. He had then (and still does) a stylistic range that other musicians would sell their souls for, be it the influence of country ("Border Song"), soul ("Bennie and the Jets"), old fashion radio tunes ("Crocodile Rock"), love songs ("Don\'t Let The Sun Go Down On Me") and hard rock (the blistering "Saturday Night\'s Alright for Fighting"). Elton\'s brashness knew no bounds in those days, be it the flamboyant stage gear to the over the top album package that went with "Goodbye Yellow Brick Road," which carried into his music. He was willing to try anything, and his hunger for stardom drove his creativity.The results of that drive are here in this perfect time capsule about how the seventies were most certainly NOT a dark time for music. That Sir Elton is still releasing albums ("The Captain and the Kid") of strong new material and not taking the easy road of recording a sappy album of standards (I\'m looking at you, Rod Stewart) speaks to the genius of Elton and Bernie.

Featuring every one of his Top 10 singles recorded up to that point, \'Your Song\', \'Rocket Man\', \'Honky Cat\', \'Crocodile Rock\', \'Daniel\', \'Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\', \'Bennie and the Jets\', \'Don\'t Let the Sun Go Down on Me\' plus three more tracks. Standard jewel case"AHHHH...but I missed the last sentence disclaimer: "--This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."Well, this Polydor release/version is NOT digitally remastered...in fact, the sound quality is EXACTLY the same as the low-quality MCA CD I picked up in a pawn shop many years ago (yeah, I\'m a geek...I compared the spectrographs of a couple songs from both CDs on my computer...they were identical...which comfirmed what my ears had already guessed).  If you\'re not picky about sound quality, that won\'t likely be a big problem, but if you were looking for some improvement, you won\'t get it with this re-release.As for the music, it\'s just standard, awesome Elton (before he got too crotchety).  The 70\'s were his decade and his Greatest Hits (vol 1 and 2) are terrific displays of everything he had going while in his prime. If you can find a remastered version of this CD, get it...this music deserves much better treatment than it has on this release version.', 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': '5+ For the music...2 for the unimproved sound quality', 'unixReviewTime': 1216598400, 'reviewTime': '07 21, 2008'}
