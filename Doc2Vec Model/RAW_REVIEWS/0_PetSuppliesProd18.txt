They are each allowed a strip after I trim their nails as a TREAT. Minnow sniffed it and walked away.

He pulled his mouth away from the tube and strings of the stuff hung down from his mouth.  Of course he shook his head to try and get the stuff off of his mouth and it flung everywhere.  Now I was discusted by it.  It is very sticky and runny now. The other cat wouldn't even touch it.  Just removing the cap causes strings of the stuff to stretch between the cap and the tube.

I  thought, oh, great, they responded to cats and cat owners!  But, NO!

Acacia Gum is a somewhat sweet product of the Acacia tree and appears to have some anti-inflammatory properties.  Acidified Calcium Sulfate is a desiccant and sometimes use to thicken other ingredients.  Caramel is a food additive that acts as a sweetener and color enhancer.  Glycerin is a thickener.  Potassium Sorbate is a food preservative.  Sodium Benzoate is a preservative.  Thiamine HCl is a nutritional supplement.It appears that the company has taken a very good, simple formula and fouled it up with a group of probably cheaper but less benign ingredients.I am furious that they are selling this as the original--it obviously is not--and for some reason think people will buy it!

I ordered one tube anyway, just in cse my cat still liked it, because we were running out, and she LOVES her petromalt...she didn\'t like the new formula.  I wrote in to Sergeants on their website and complained.  I got a reply right back saying they were sorry, and they\'d gotten a lot of complaints, and I could either get some coupons or a refund.  I sent them back the almost-full tube.I then went several of my local pet stores.  The ingredients list IS right there on the box.  I did find five tubes of the old formula on the shelves at my local petco and petsmart (bought them both out).  Today, I got a box in the mail from Sergeant\'s with a small tube of old-formula fish flavor (which it turns out my cat apparently does like), and a note, which reads, in part:Thank you for contacting Sergeant\'s Pet Care Products regarding the Sentry HC Petromalt Hairball Relief product that you recently purchased.  We were sorry to hear that you were not satisfied with the product.  Our Quality Assurance and Research and Development Departments were made aware of the issue and have decided to bring back the original formulation....The original formula will start to be available in stores the beginning of next year.Thank you for taking the time to contact us, Sergeant\'s values your comments and concerns. If you have any further questions or concerns about any of our products, please do not hesitate to contact us at 1-800-224-7387 (option #5).  Your use of our products and continued patronage is greatly appreciated.Looks like we\'ve been heard!In the meantime, while I was at another petstore today before I got this good news in the mail, I found a product called "Excel Hairball Remedy", which seems to have a somewhat similar ingredient list to the original petromalt (main ingredient mineral oil, plus Malt Syrup and some other stuff).  It\'s not exactly the same, but my cat seems to like it pretty well.  Might be worth looking for, for those of you who can\'t find the old formula anywhere.

I even referenced all of the customers they have lost on Amazon and suggested they read the ongoing list of negative reviews about the formula change. They wrote back in April that they would be changing their formula back to the original.My cat only likes the original petromalt formula. I can force her to eat the other stuff but it isn\'t fun and it\'s very messy. She would eat the original petromalt right out of the tube.
