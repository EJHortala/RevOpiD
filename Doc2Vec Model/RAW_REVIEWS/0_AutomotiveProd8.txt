(The area done in the picture I used close to a 1/4 of a 16 oz. bottle) I bought two bottles, may be able to get the set done with that, but I am ordering another bottle just in case, so far I am pleased, this set will be going into storage soon, I might do a review when I bring it back out to show how well this product works.I WANT TO ADD A FEW DAYS AFTER APPLYING THE TEAK OIL THE PRETTY SHEEN SHOWN IN THE PICTURE (HALF OF MY TABLETOP WAS COATED) IT WENT BACK TO LOOKING THE WAY IT USED TO, GRANTED THIS SET IS ONLY 2-3 MOTHS OLD, SO i WILL NOT BE BUYING ANOTHER BOTTLE OF THIS TO FINISH THE SET, GOING TO LOOK INTO OTHER OPTIONS, GOING TO POST THE PIC OF MY TABLESET A FEW DAYS LATER FOR YOU TO SEE, AND THE PICS ARE DATED SO YOU CAN SEE HOW LONG IT LASTED :(', 'overall': 2.0, 'summary': 'Loved it at first, but 2 days later back to the same, (I posted pics of my table)', 'unixReviewTime': 1349654400, 'reviewTime': '10 8, 2012'}

The description said it should be oiled.  I knew Meguiar's brand from my car use, so I picked this up from Amazon based on price and reviews.I can't be any happier with the results.  The bench looked good after assembly, but a bit dull.  After applying this once, it looks great.  I'm about to add another coat.  I'm excited to see what it will look like after three full coats.  If one is any indication, it should be really nice.I can't comment on how this would fare in a marine environment on a boat or in a always wet one, like a shower.
