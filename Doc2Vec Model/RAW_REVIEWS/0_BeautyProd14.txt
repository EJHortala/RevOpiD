I find that this is a very good, basic shower gel for daily use. My combination skin seems to react well to it, but I can see how this could be a little drying to those with dryer skin (nothing a good after shower moisturizer can't combat). This gel rinses clean with no residue, and just feels clean and comfortable after using. I feel that it is a step above the usual drugstore body wash.I chose to try the honey mango scent, and I find it to be relatively cloying when smelled directly. In the shower during use however, I find it to be a pleasant sweet/fruity scent. Perhaps the other scents will provide something more up my alley. I will definitely be purchasing this shower gel in the future to try the other scents because the value can't be beat.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Great Value for A Basic Shower Gel!', 'unixReviewTime': 1378080000, 'reviewTime': '09 2, 2013'}
