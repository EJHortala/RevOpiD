When in the garden carry a small sharpening stone and be sure to sharpen the pruners often.  If they are not cleaned, and do not use water as it will ruin the blade and does not kill any disease that may have gotten on the blade, the blade will get gummy with sap and not open properly.

I found them clumsy, difficult to maneuver, and obviously designed for a man's hand.  After three days of light use, the center spring fell out.  I came to amazon determined to find an adequate set of American made clippers and ordered the Coronas.  The center spring is lively and doesn't balk at cutting thicker small tree limbs.  The blades slice cleanly.  The slim design permits the tool to enter tight spots and the grip is great for those of use with smaller hands.  I've given them a thorough work out on everything from out-of-control vines to rose bushes to shrubs and they've sailed through every task.
