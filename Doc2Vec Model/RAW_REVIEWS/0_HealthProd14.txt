Overall, I definitely enjoyed this bar, and from a flavor perspective, I would not hesitate to buy it again.The reason I gave this bar 4 stars instead of 5 was due to the nutritional profile.  At 200 calories, it is about what you would expect from a protein bar; I was fine with that.  But both the fat content (7 grams, including 3.5 grams saturated) and the sugar content (17 grams, or over 3 teaspoons) were a little on the high side to me.  Some bars include fiber; this one has &lt;1 gram.  It does have 15 grams of protein, which was a big plus.So, in the end, I probably will buy this bar again, but I will limit myself to using it occasionally rather than as a more regular, healthy part of my diet.", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Mocha chip--yum!', 'unixReviewTime': 1299369600, 'reviewTime': '03 6, 2011'}

No strange aftertaste, and real hints of honey (the peanut is a little harder to discern).  The texture is soft but with some heft, and, on entry one senses honey, sugar, a hint of peanut and oil, and a vague spicy background. IT\'s excellent, and not as sweet as the similar but too-sugary (for my taste) yoghurt honey peanut flavor.My only complaints (and this comes from the head, not the taste, Bud) are the plethora of vitamin and mineral additives (just a personal preference there), and the 3.5 grams of saturated fat, and 17 grams of sugar. However, this is within the range, I believe, of most of these products.On the positive side, you get 14 grams of sugar, and high percentage of the recommended daily values of a range of vitamins and minerals. Have one of these with a 2-3 lasses of water and you will feel full.  Also great as a post work-out pick-me-up.

I used to eat another Balance Bar flavor (Honey Peanut), but found that I quickly tired of that taste.

This way, it tastes like a real brownie.  Well, maybe that's a stretch, but after eating about 2000 (yes indeed) of these bars over the years, my taste buds have adjusted to the taste.Almond Brownie is my favorite Balance Bar flavor by far.  In addiion to eating it cold, I can also eat it warm (if it's been siting in my car -- I live in Florida) along with water.Looks like Amazon Grocery has the lowest price by about 10%, which could save me up to $100 per year.By the way, I think the review dates for this Amazon Grocery item (and perhaps all reviews of Amazon Grocery items) are incorrect since all reviews appear to be from January 2000.
