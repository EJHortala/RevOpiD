I just love how it gets conversation going far more than with the person who grabs the card.  You have everyone take a card then go around and answer the questions. I give people enough time to think about their answer while eating if it\'s a huge group, or if it is an intimate dinner party, we just go around and keep talking.Let\'s say you get the card for example "What would you choose for your last meal?"  A guy answers some steak house and his excellent cook wife does a playful slam...then everyone begins talking about the steak he named and their favorite place.  And some new restaurant everyone has to try...Or let\'s say you get the card "If you got a tattoo what would it be and where would you put it?" It\'s great when someone has a tattoo that no one knows about--that always starts a discussion about tattoos and why someone has them or someone says something funny like "If I ever got a tattoo it would be something really messed up because I would NEVER get a tattoo so I\'d have to be really messed up if I did get one."Just silly things.  It makes you think too though: "If you could have any view from your back porch what would it be?" The funny gal might say "a view of Bratt Pitt serving me dinner" while the traveler might say "A view of the ocean in Bora Bora" whereas the nature lover might say "A view of deer roaming, chickens frolicking, a stream bubbling, surrounded by trees and rocks"  It can be taken very differently by different people."What would you try if you had no fear?" gets the person holding the card to really ask themselves questions..including why they haven\'t tried something they want to: like starting a business, skydiving, learning to fly a plane...It breaks the ice with questions you could not just bust out and ask, but that work great for learning about everyone without being forceful in your questions--it makes the game maker the one who asks the question and it gets conversation ROCKING for a great evening.Also a very fun gift and  a way to get the family talking during the holidays as well.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Livens up a gathering of people, especially dinner parties.

Top 4 worst: "which 3 political issues are most important to you?" "what would you most like to ask God?" and "which vice would you indulge in if it had no negative side effects?" "what amendments should be made to the U.S. Constitution?". These 4 I felt were inappropriate to ask my Boss or someone I didn\'t know much about, or a diverse group of people. These 3, I felt were too personal: "what\'s the last thing you cried about?" "what\'s one thing you\'ve done that you\'d like to erase?" "has anything ever happened to you that turned out to be for the best?". Another reviewer said "what would you like to change about your childhood?" I don\'t seem to have this question in my deck. Each of these I feel can be answered innocuously, but if someone has experienced something traumatic, it might make them uncomfortable and it may be difficult for them to come up with a "safe" answer. There are no rules forcing anyone to answer, but I want to avoid someone even sitting there uncomfortably, asking to "pass" on the question. So, I simply threw these cards out, and there isn\'t a large gap in the box with only 7 cards missing. Now, I think I can use this with anyone...family, young or old, business or personal, old friends or new friends. I would agree with the game\'s label, that it might be difficult for children under 12 to answer some of these questions though, so an adult or young adult crowd seems best.
