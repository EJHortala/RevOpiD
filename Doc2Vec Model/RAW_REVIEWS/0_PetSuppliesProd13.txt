I thought the flavors would be separate, but they're not- one pale color, and flavors blended into one.  The taste is OK, and easy enough to chew through, and I won't throw them away. I probably won't reorder.Can't review separately once doing a review on one- SO :Blueberry, Raspberry, and Boysenberry Flavor- same vitamin C content and sources.  Reminds me of the smell of fish food flakes- absolutely DISGUSTING, when expecting normally tasty berry flavors.  Maybe the red cabbage that they use to color the tablets is what does it.  I won't be able to choke these down. Wasted money.  Really disgusting. I usually love anything berry flavored. Oy.  Would make a good puke inducer if someone swallowed poison. :oEdit: 10-26-2012.... threw the berry disasters in the trash.  They tasted THAT bad.  To be fair, I've still got some residual taste/smell issues following extensive chemotherapy- but I generally have trouble with savory things- not berries.  I'm still wondering if the red cabbage used to color them is the problem.  Fish food flakes is the thing that immediately came to mind.Edit: later 10-26-2012... the Mixed Fruit flavor arrived today.  These are separated into various flavors- the berry is the same nasty concoction as the Blueberry, Raspberry, and Boysenberry.  There are supposed to be four flavors- I can't find but three- so who knows.  One of them is tolerable- but I'm not going to spend time fishing through a pile of fish flake smelling stuff to find the odd tolerable one.  Trash bin fodder.
