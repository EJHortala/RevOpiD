They have permanent sticking power and are a strong enough white that nothing will show through the label.  This is important now that so many companies are trying to be green by recycling old shipping cartons. If your company doesn\'t do this yet, suggest that they do so.  It will save them money (green!) when they don\'t buy new shipping cartons and reduces the cost of waste removal (more green!).  AND, it keeps cartons out of landfills, which is the greenest part of the whole deal.Back to the labels.  A while back, I reviewed some labels that had Microsoft Word templates you could load onto a computer and design the labels of your dreams.  I commented that most companies have rules against anyone but the IT department loading software onto their computers, which made the software less than practical for the people who use these at work.  Avery has now solved this problem:  they still offer the Microsoft word uploads, but you can also go to their web site and design the labels of your dreams without putting anything on your work machine. I tried the Microsoft Word add-on software and was impressed by the results.My project was to pack up some old summer clothes in old copy paper boxes, labeling each box top and bottom so that they could be retrieved easily.  Copy paper boxes are printed with many dark colors and graphics, and if the label was going to have a show through problem, this was the time for it.  The no show through technology worked like a charm - nothing shows through onto the face of the label, and it\'s a cinch to find my "outgrown bathing suits - won\'t fit again in this lifetime."Why four stars instead of five?

They are a very nice size, you can fit (with logo and your own return address) depending on font size, 6 - 8 lines.

Either way, I intend to place a strip of tape over all my labels, just to be safe for my customers. This label doesn\'t smudge, I\'m just very particular. Love the product!

The student roster page only has room for 36 students and there is only one sheet.  There are four half-page rectangles laid out for the seating charts and you will have to draw them yourself.  There is one page which is very well laid out for substitute teacher information.  There is a lesson planner inside separated by a heavier tabbed paper with a four year calendar on the first page (2014-2016).  There is an undated Year-at-a-Glance section on two pages before the daily planner begins.  There are 41 weeks of planning pages.  The lines are printed in a dark burgundy and are very clear.  There is room to write notes and each day is 1/5 of the page and travels across two full pages.  The Grade Records section is also a heavier material and tabbed.  There is a percent finder for grading and then about 32 full double pages which each contain 10 weeks ( a square for each day) for 36 students.  There are some reference pages in the back.  The cover and back are made with a heavy material, kind of like file folder paper, but quite a bit stronger.I imagine that this Lesson Planner and Record book is made more for an elementary teacher than a high school teacher because there aren't enough spots for seating charts, lists of students, etc., for most high school teachers.  What I will probably do is to tape in some printed sheets in the front of the book and leave this at my desk for substitutes.  I really like the look of the book and the stronger dark lines in the charts.  It is a pretty book and very well organized.  It would have been nice to know more of the particulars before I purchased the book.", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'Nice book', 'unixReviewTime': 1404518400, 'reviewTime': '07 5, 2014'}
