Cluster 0_pos:
1. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards
2. Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months
3. It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider
4. This thing was a steal for $25
5. It is of high quality
6. for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate
7. I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me
8. Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis
9. If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable,
10. would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine
11. This is great
12. This is only a minor issue
13. I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason
14. If you are looking for a heavy duty piece of equipment
15. operation after a winter of holding cargo
16. This is a must have for pickup truck owners
17. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about
18. still works like a champ
19. It is made of good quality material
20. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating
21. This cargo bar is well made

Cluster 0_neg:
1. This looks like a high quality cargo bar, but on the 2nd use, the ratcheting function broke
2. paid more for a better made product he found in a store

Cluster 1_pos:
1. The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps
2. You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click
3. The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate,
4. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar
5. It works great on my Ford Ranger pickup
6. I would absolutely purchase again
7. It has worked well since being put in place
8. I purchase this item several weeks ago
9. The ratchet part works great
10. Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed!
11. This was more sturdy
12. I was expecting something more sturdy
13. It may function to restrain small light items but not much more
14. Easy to install, has worked well so far
15. It fit my pick-up very well
16. Great item , best one I have ever used
17. I just love shopping at Amazon,because they have so many great merchants
18. It works well on my '07 Tacoma
19. The one works ok
20. It was okay, but cumbersome
21. I should've had one these years ago
22. This one works great every time
23. It fits my 6
24. I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works
25. It was very easy to install (old lady here)
26. This product works very well
27. I recommend them highly
28. Lets hope this second one lives up to it's potential
29. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about
30. Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps
31. work great
32. This seems to work fine so far

Cluster 1_neg:
1. Cargo bar will not tighten tight enough to hold its self up let alone holding cargo
2. find one to fit! Packing should have been better
3. I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight

Cluster 2_pos:
1. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product
2. It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range
3. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle)
4. It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much
5. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche
6. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet
7. So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

Cluster 2_neg:
1. some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED

Cluster 3_pos:
1. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great
2. This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall
3. matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar
4. This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks)
5. It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there

Cluster 3_neg:
1. When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck

Cluster 4_pos:
1. Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short
2. Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks
3. When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space
4. Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing
5. So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly,

Cluster 4_neg:

Cluster 5_pos:
1. if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar
2. I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed
3. puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it
4. Easy to place in the truck
5. I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup

Cluster 5_neg:
1. I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck
2. So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck
3. drops to the bottom of the truck bed
4. when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy
5. I received the cargo bar

Cluster 6_pos:
1. Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering
2. Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews
3. ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks
4. hope they are still there wherever I'm going
5. gas cans in place during our 800 mile death valley off road adventure
6. It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab

Cluster 6_neg:
1. Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!
2. i geass its good for truck only because its metel internal
3. (No staying-put power)I will try the twist type system next

Cluster 7_pos:
1. you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place
2. it took forever to get right
3. This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed
4. for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do
5. I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure
6. I haven't had any problems with it, but it's a little difficult to get it to release some times
7. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!
8. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly

Cluster 7_neg:
1. difficult to release it will not hold anything stable that has any weight to it
2. Missing a screw at one end now I have to go to store

Cluster 8_pos:
1. Good construction, use it as a cargo separator under my tonneau cover
2. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed
3. At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls
4. use them to support my slide-out on my Lance truck camper when extended
5. Stays in place very well
6. It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home
7. have only owned it for about 3 weeks
8. Keeps my load in place
9. requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly
10. It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner
11. Once secured in place it stays there
12. Just received it for Christmas
13. with the rubber feet stays firmly in place
14. Worked well in my truck bed with bedliner
15. Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC
16. Just crank down on it
17. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening
18. Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world
19. So please get familiar with it before you need it

Cluster 8_neg:
1. makes it worthless
2. It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it
3. Could only achieve tension to hold bar in place in certain spots
4. installed on my truck

Cluster 9_pos:
1. I would recommend them to a friend
2. I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline
3. I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup
4. I do not recommend this cargo bar
5. I bought this one
6. I bought this cargo bar in a hurry to keep our coolers
7. I bought this

Cluster 9_neg:
1. I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed
2. I would recommend you keep looking for a sturdier cargo bar

Cluster 10_pos:
1. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute,
2. Good Cargo Bar
3. Holds things inplace,

2. Keeper 05059 Ratcheting Cargo BarSorry  Will S

Cluster 11_pos:
1. Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada
2. lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected
3. stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells

Cluster 11_neg:
1. The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew)

Cluster 12_pos:
1. I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net
2. My husband asked for a similar item as a gift but I wanted to see reviews so I shopped Amazon
3. Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one
4. I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!
5. Perfect for my needs -- I was a little concerned by the "pinching" reviews, but I had no problems in that regards
6. Just what I was looking for
7. I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how -

Cluster 12_neg:
1. I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar
2. I was buying for my jeep cherokee for when I lower the back seat for storage

Cluster 13_pos:
1. it was secure
2. returned it
3. it makes it easier to carry stuff from the store without having the stuff slide forward
4. it was O
5. With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing
6. I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it
7. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it
8. Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point
9. Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it
10. Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy

Cluster 13_neg:
1. Guess where it ends up when you try to use it? In the middle of the bed
2. When it is tightened it just pops off the gear
3. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it

Cluster 14_pos:
1. doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler
2. For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded
3. Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to

Cluster 14_neg:

Cluster 15_pos:
1. Much needed tool for anyone that has a truck
2. Fits in any location

7. it stays in place

26. Seems to be built very well too
27. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado
28. operates smoothly
29. If I had to think of a weakness

44. the shipping time was less than expected
45. overall very happy with product
46. service
47. I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab
48. I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly
49. No regrets from me on this purchase
50. Super value
51. Nice cargo bar for the price
52. racheting works good
53. Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on
54. didn't seem to hold as well
55. It,however,is a low cost,durable multi use product
56. capacity
57. Highly recommend this product
58. Easy to snap in
59. take out
60. Holds things very securely in the bed of the truck
61. my brother-in-law said I could use his
62. I like the fact that it really stretches out there
63. You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars
64. two more clicks
65. left the Ratcheting bar in place
66. working
67. topper
68. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds
69. I would be on the fence to recommend this product
70. Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now,
71. No slipping
72. loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product
73. It's one of those you get what you pay for
74. I ordered it
75. fit my needs better
76. Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy
77. You can tell by the feel
78. weight that it's cheap, but it does what it's suppose to
79. It's easy to set up, easy to remove
80. K
81. The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position
82. It's a bit tricky to get used too
83. In my opinion a good value as well

85. a good value for the cost
86. ,
87. Very high quality item
88. I have had no problems with it
89. Great product, works real well
90. the product was awesome thank you very much!!see you soon!
91. I wanted a strong ratchet type bar
92. Would buy again!
93. seems to have plenty of strength
94. My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy
95. I have already pinched my fingers in it several times
96. My advice is to just be careful
97. wear gloves while adjusting it
98. stays in place without damage
99. The price is right too
100. One is broken
101. Open your box ASAP
102. uninstalling - quickly
103. forth - totally unacceptable
104. This solved the problem immediately,
105. at reasonable cost
106. to what - it might attach
107. This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
108. worked great
109. Keeps items from moving around
110. holds them steady
111. It has not failed me yet
112. Performs exactly as expected

126. 5' F150 truck bed perfectly
127. When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced
128. The ratcheting mechanism is very rough
129. works excellent
130. The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted
131. Also the finish seems to be good quality
132. I'd buy it again
133. Outstanding price

135. was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home

143. A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality
144. I drive a 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty
145. keep looking
146. BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight
147. simple this may be a good choice
148. Perfect for keeping stuff from sliding around the bed of a truck during normal driving
149. My Ranger has one of those useless
150. These cargo bars fit it perfectly - no complaints with the quality
151. Other than that, it works perfectly
152. Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak
153. The ratchet part is very well made
154. You can secure this
155. know for sure that your cargo is not moving
156. Have had no problems at all
157. stores behind the seat of my Chevy Colorado pickup
158. It provides a sturdy anchor for my cargo bed contents

165. If you are like me, I just through items in the back of my truck
166. Great Product
167. seller
168. A+++++++++++++
169. so far it has worked great
170. has never budged unless I have removed it intentionally
171. Spreads
172. retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner
173. back
174. I often travel with a slide in camper on my pickup
175. when at a campground, take the camper off
176. That leaves me without a tailgate
177. I had to return one already because it broke
178. Great for keeping the ice chest at the back of the truck
179. Keeps it from sliding around
180. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar
181. am not sure if other bars do this
182. anything
183. definitely worth the price

185. After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit
186. lone behold its still right where I left it
187. My cargo held tight
188. Overall great product
189. fast shipping
190. Just as I expected it held in place the entire trip
191. it got abused
192. Lots of bumps
193. jumps
194. I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded
195. difficult to extend constently
196. I recomend it highly very easy to adjust
197. What can I say just a perfect design works excellent
198. The quality is there, 
199. hard to learn at first
200. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down
201. even give you a pinch (or two)
202. workmanship
203. Fit great into my S10
204. capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place
205. the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate
206. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask)
207. came back to buy another one
208. After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar
209. am glad I did
210. Its lighter
211. quicker
212. easier to install
213. move
214. the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed
215. Product is just as described, works just like a ratchet strap
216. Excellent deal!!  Would buy more if needed more
217. Thanks

Cluster 15_neg:
1. It's useless now
2. would not stay locked in place on the desired adjustment
3. We returned the item
4. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars
5. I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon
6. The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides
7. it will not stay where I put it,
8. The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center
9. I am just about 6 feet tall
10. Waste of time
11. money! If the mech was closer to one side this would be a great product!
12. anywhere else in many years
13. You lock it in place
14. hit a bump with the truck
15. it slips back two or three teeth
16. Didn't look, but probably made in China
17. Defective ratchet
18. Will not hold in place
19. Perhaps I just got a lemon
20. will not create enough tension to hold in place
21. it still will not hole very good
22. i tok this item to my SUV, its defict the plastic internal
23. Ratchet unit slips when you put a load on it
24. Won't work for what I had in mind for it
25. I might be able to find something it will work with
26. weak the ratchet is also a weak point
27. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck
28. The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place
29. The locking mechanism simply would not hold
30. I tried to install it in several locations
31. it would just pop off
32. The device is not worth it
33. Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy
34. You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk
35. Back in the box
36. the return process started within 15 min of receiving it
37. I was disappointed in the bar diameter
38. overall durability
39. When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit
40. jump a detent on the ratchet bar
41. Which would in my opinon make this system useless for my needs
42. New Hampshire

Cluster 16_pos:
1. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain
2. The bar feels solid
3. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband,
4. The item was shipped
5. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click
6. The shipping speed was terrific
7. This bar fits my Dodge Ram 1500 fine
8. The result was an incessant flopping back
9. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds

Cluster 16_neg:
1. This item was horrible

Cluster 17_pos:
1. held my cargo in the bed of my truck from Colorado to Southern California
2. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy
3. I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed
4. find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box
5. Been a great cargo bar, I use it for holding plastic bins in place in the bed of my truck

Cluster 17_neg:
1. I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350

Cluster 18_pos:
1. The cargo bar is great
2. This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed
3. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in
4. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time
5. If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it
6. Someone recommended a cargo bar

Cluster 18_neg:
1. I would recommend trying a different cargo bar

Cluster 19_pos:
1. The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw
2. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened
3. the mechanism operates smoothly
4. he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist
5. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard
6. thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension
7. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate
8. The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer)
9. secures very well using the ratchet mechanism

Cluster 19_neg:
1. The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked

Cluster 20_pos:
1. When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance
2. it is still in place
3. would recommend it to friends  it is  great
4. this is exactly it
5. it is a pain

Cluster 21_neg:

1. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep
2. I even use it to secure a line of grocery bags on the ride home from the market
3. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give

3. This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks
4. consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls
