2: I have used at least 20 of them so far & have yet to come across one that doesn't work well
3: This package, as an 'add-on' item, cost under 10 cents per pen so I ordered two and took them in
4: 60 pens in one box for a low price! I haven't used all the pens so far, but what I've used and given away worked without problems
5: At the time of this review this box of 60 pens is only 54 cents higher in cost than buying a 10 pack on Amazon
6: So for 54 cents you get 50 more pens, that's an obviously fantastic deal
7: The front label says &#34;Writes first time, every time!&#34; I tried all 10 pens and only 2 would write

Cluster 7:

5: I'm happy with the purchase

Cluster 8:

2: They go through a lot of pens - customers take them, bussers toss them, they drop them, etc
3: I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff
4: For you pen chewers out there you can chew away, and always have another in the box you can lend out without getting those looks (you know what I'm talking about)
5: I buy a big box of pens and keep some at home, in kitchen, by computer, books, in my bag, a few to give and forget aboutwhen someone asks to "borrow a pen",
6: What a good deal, with prime! Enough pens to keep my volleyball team writing away on their statistics sheets for a couple season, hopefully
7: They taste great with a little garlic butter and tomato sauce over pasta
8: Great price, came quickly - so many pens leftover from my project (handing them out at a booth) that I'll be set for pens for a while :)

Cluster 9:
1: If you're into blue ball point pens, this is where its at
2: The color is almost a pink instead of a nice red

5: These pens are blue
6: They're basic and blue which is what you expect when you're buying these
7: If you want a basic blue ballpoint, this is it

Cluster 10:
1: comfortable in your hand but i was surprised how well the ink comes out and write, for dirt cheap pens I love the way they look and feel
2: I personally don't mind  using them, I live with a few people in my house and my pens tend to get lost  quite often
3: BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they don't mind putting them down with credit card receipts
4: Great cheap item so far every pen i have used has worked first try i would recommend buy this alot of pen for a great cheap price
5: I have the little twerps! And I don't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests
6: I will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location, to save money I presume, I certainly did not see the price of these things, cheap though they  may be, going down any, for us, the consumer
7: these bic pens are great pens which come in a neatly designed box i use these pens in my business for customers to sign their receipts and work orders they last and work well
8: These are your basic every day pens that are so darn cheap you don't much care when they grow their legs and disappear on you
9: I manage a small business and have a great need of pens, to save money I was buying cheap pens but luckily got these
10: You can even fling the pen caps! I love these pens but whatever you do, don't put them in the freezer
11: I bought a box of these to keep in our kitchen drawer and they are perfect for everyday use
12: Comfortable to write with and priced cheap enough that losing them isn't too much of a bummer
13: good  pens don't love how ya have to pull off the cap instead of click it open but they write well
14: Gets two stars because they're cheap and you could leave them out at a business and people wouldn't be very tempted to take them home

Cluster 11:
1: I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably, sure as the sun rises, there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil (I always keep several packages of pencils too
2: As an additional advantage, I do not mind writing short notes with them myself, and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk
3: These pens will serve your check book well (does anyone still use those things? I do, but I'm old school like that), take great notes in school, and scribble a quick note at your desk without fuss
4: I would say that there are maybe 1-2 duds per pack of 60, but it was the cheapest pen I could find online, and much more reliable than freebie promotional pens
5: So, if you just want something to write with that doesn&#8217;t have to come with the bells and whistles of a personalized gold pen, or say a calligraphy pen set, then I think anyone would be satisfied with this offering from the folks at Bic
6: five stars for the price, i got them very cheap;  with four  kids that use pens often  and loose them even more often the price was awesome; will be buying more later
7: I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!
8: I love the fact that 10 pens allows several throughout the house so they're always available when you need it - especially by the phones with a pad

Cluster 12:
1: I paid less than $5
2: Other than that, highly recommend!
3: just a lot more of them!
4: What more can you ask?
5: For less than $0

Cluster 13:
1: If your looking for cheap then this is what you need to get, If your looking for fancy and attractive this is not it for you
2: Overall a good buy, although for some reason the black was not available which is what most people like, but the blue is fine, too
3: Can't go wrong with these!  Love these ball point pens, they work great, never have any issues, and for the price it is amazing
4: If you want a pen (60 of them, even!) that writes good and clean, and is very reliable, buy these!
5: If you don't use them for several months, you'll find that several pens do not actually write at all and you will need to throw them away
6: While these are not the type of pens you would want to write with for a long period of time, they are a great buy

3: If the student forgets to return the pen
4: no more to say about this pen
5: (one being not having working pen handy when needed) This product has solved that problem
6: you never know when you need a pen or could lend a pen
7: But to hand out to clients that will not return, it's perfect, that was we don't lose our better pens
8: its annoying when every other pen does not work
9: If you pull a pen from the box, it will write, and it will write smoothly
10: Nothing like writing out a character and looking at it and realizing that half the lines didn't make a mark
11: What's worse is that once one of these pestilent pens calls it quits, there's nothing you can do with the abomination except throw it away

Cluster 17:
1: i use these for ccdw classes and havent had a problem yet
2: Like another reviewer here, I am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame

2: Lots of pens that write very smooth

4: I'm a happy man
5: I am bummed I have a lot of them

11: The picture on the box was not what I received
12: Arrived promptly and as described
13: 60 for $5
14: Now, I'm not as concerned with whether, or not, I get the pens back because replacing them doesn't cost me an arm and a leg
15: The grandchildren were very happy to receive them just before school started
16: I was really glad that I could receive the package within a short time
17: Your basic pen in a high enough quantity that you don't mind if a few dozen go missing
18: However, I noticed that they're now made in Mexico
19: Good quality pen at the right price!
20: I find the medium size is bold enough to see without being in optimum light
21: The cost of each pen is great, I don't mind lending these to someone that needs one
22: There of course is a reason for this
23: "  Ha
24: which often happens, I am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them
25: but what are you going to do?  I guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter
26: Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks
27: Won't need to buy any pens for a while
28: I bought a couple of these for my smaller ambulance corp and they work great
29: I gave these to friends in a Nursing Home to write their life stories in!  Those who are writing their stories are having a good time remimicing
30: I bought these to write notes on Christmas cards but did not like them
31: The ink is very scant and light colored
32: They won't win any beauty contests, but they do put ink on paper, and they do it cheaply
33: Other than that, these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat
34: Pens just seem to appear &#34;cheap
35: &#34;  You get items for the price you pay
36: Okay lets be serious now

67: These pens are kind of my standard dependable pens
68: Definitely recommended if you have cashiers at work who chew through pens at an astonishing rate
69: Very frustrating to use
70: They seem to dry/clog up instantly, and it is impossible to maintain a train of thought with there constant ineptitude, grinding the gears to a halt
71: There are a lot of places these pens can be shoved, but they only belong in one dark, smelly hole--and it ain't a landfill
72: Gooeydoo Books never filled this order: I AM STILL WAITING FOR A CREDIT/REFUND TO MY ACCOUNT
73: Enough for at least 2 years! Smooth and durable

Cluster 20:
1: Works fine most of the time, blobs out ink other times, but hey, GREAT PRICE, and I've lost half of them already, so who cares?
2: These pens are easy to handle, write well, and come in a nice shade of blue
3: these bic pens always work the best and the blue was just cheaper but is more vibrant color so works out well when signing paperwork
4: They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within
5: Good Value, 60 smooth writing smudge free ink pens in a lightweight barrel with a removable cap
6: i was needing some basic  ink pens the bic did the trick  they are good ink pens  if you need basic writeing pens theses pen,s will do it
7: We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens, with the white barrel, medium or fine points
8: It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color
9: The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white
10: The Cristal pens have a wider point or something, even though these are both labeled as medium points
11: Also had them in black and red, so ordered 2 blues and one black and one red
12: They are black ink pens that I love to use when writing down things
13: Unless you prefer black ink, then keep moving (but I am sure BIC makes a lovely black pen as well)

Cluster 21:

2: They will always write on the paper! I can't tell you how many pens I've got that didn't write on the paper

Cluster 24:
1: Bic Pens: from plain (like these) to "fancy", they write, they write, they write -- they are inexpensive, seem to last a looong time, and create GREAT multiple copies because you press em as hard as you want and they write, they write, they write
2: Bic are my favorite pens, as they write despite the weather or time stored
3: I think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems!  This is usually one product on which you can count, to not leak all over the place and still write nicely, and for a long time
4: I tend to lose a lot of pens before they run out of ink, so can't speak to how long they'll last, but I'm sure i'll be buying these again once i lose all 60 again
5: People lose pens all the time and these are so inexpensive that I don't feel bad constantly giving out new ones like I have to do anyway
6: They last pretty long for the harsh use they go through, the ink doesn't wash off with rain or water, and they even seem to write well in harsh conditions
7: They write well enough for daily needs and if your work environment is anything like mine you'll start to find your lost pens all over the place
8: These pens are fine if used sooner else it gets harder and a little rough to use
9: I am making sporadic edits to a paper with these pieces of trash and they can't even make it from the top of the page to the bottom

Cluster 25:
1: The design is simple and the cap nicely fits both the ink-side the end-side
2: Some pen caps don't really fit the end, so you end up losing the cap
3: There isn't much to say about these pens, but the cap being able to fit nicely at the end is a plus
4: The caps were extremely hard to pull off
5: The caps go on and off easily with minimal force
6: The clip on the caps however make it hard to attach to the lapel or shirt

Cluster 26:
1: These are decent quality and an awesome price
2: First they are quite inexpensive
3: Third they are available anywhere
4: These BICs have superb action
5: This is a very good deal
6: They are very functional for the price
7: These are just basic pens, nothing special
8: This ten pack is a great value
9: Pens write well and are a good value
10: 10/pen, these are absolutely a steal

Cluster 27:
1: Well, after losing money on pens that I bought in the 12pk and handed out but were never returned, I began to use my head instead of my purse
2: I have to buy a bunch of these for the office since they keep disappearing
3: My employees like them so I think I will continue to buy them
4: I have found that even I have trouble loosing these things if I buy them a dozen at a time
5: It's true! What else could cause them to disappear? I think they're forming a colony somewhere in the house, I just hope they don't make a move to take over
6: I keep losing them though, which makes me have to keep buying more
7: I can loan them out and if they don't come back to me I am not out alot of money
8: cant beat this price for these pins! I go through a lot of pins at work and these have never been an issue for me

Cluster 28:
1: I wasn't looking for the best writing pen so much as I was the best price
2: 00, well you bet I love the price
3: This pen would be great for a teacher/writer/company to buy
4: I thank the seller for the fast service and price
5: I got the package very fast
6: 50? Thank you so much for this nice offer in amazon
7: I was very happy to find out the quality of this pen
8: great stuff for kids, for the purchase of school supplies, good quality and excellent service

Cluster 29:
1: Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly
2: I like the new design and how comfortable they are to write with, but only annoyance is that the caps are SO hard to pull off initially!!  I had to keep twisting and tugging on the caps of all of the pens I've used to far
3: So why buy a box of 60 pens, when it takes forever just to use up a single pen?There are lots of reasons, the biggest being the well known fact that once you set a pen down and look away they grow legs and walk off
4: So, the Bic Round Stick Pen Medium Point is a nice little pen!They&#8217;re not fancy, but I was tired of paying $4 for a 2-pen set from Walgreens/CVS/The Local Grocer and such and decided to go ahead and try these as they came 60 in a box&#8230; And so basically for pennies on the dollar I have enough pens that should last myself and my relatives (as they always seem to borrow my work supplies&#8230;) well throughout the year!They work fine, come with caps and so far have not bled out in my bag like some other cheaper pens of the past
5: I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use
6: Thus, the cheaply made pen is purchased at an inflated rate, performs cheaply, and then makes it's most prominent impact on the world--not as a writing device, but as another poisonous piece of plastic, sent to join a landfill or float in an ocean: either way, rotting the earth
7: The Bic Round Stic pen is the cancer that keeps on giving; I wouldn't wish this junk product on my worst enemy, and I encourage anyone interested in giving this shameful company any money for this, or another, disposable piece of garbage to strongly reconsider and fork up the extra dough to purchase something that is made with actual quality
8: If you want to have enough of a nice normal no fuss pen that writes smoothly to get through the zombie apocalypse, if you need to get a crowd jotting things down or if you have to keep a stash of pens because you are surrounded by office supplies thieves then this is the affordable pack of lovely blue pens for you

Cluster 30:
1: I've tried all the cheaper pens and nothing are as good as these right here
2: Not the smoothest pen, nor the most comfortable to hold, but if you can get this at less than a dime per pen, it's a great value
3: WE don't use expensive pens because they walk away
4: Are there better pens out there? Of course, but they cost a heck of a lot more
5: I find the less expensive pens to do an excellent jobs
6: I've had more expensive pens that just stop working
7: For the price and all I wasn't expecting much but these pens work great right out of the box
8: Pens don't come much cheaper than this, and it shows in the quality of the product

Cluster 31:
1: I'm a teacher of Music Technology and there's always kids who come to class without anything to write with
2: I substitute teach which means I can be in a 3rd grade class one day and in an advanced high school class the next
3: I have also noted that some classes and some students will actually try to take advantage of a substitute teacher and their third favorite request the instant the bell rings is "can I go to my locker
4: This is great school supplies value for Middle School and High School students who need pens but sometimes lose them in their daily shuffle
5: Great many for the price and great for classroom use! My students are always excited to get to use a pen
6: These pens are the best!  They last a long time, too!  I will be using them mostly for school and my business
7: I use them in my classroom (I teach high school) as they are cheaper than most pencils and pens out there

Cluster 32:
1: Best little pen I ever had
2: 60 pens should last a college student such as myself a long time
3: Indeed, as another reviewer has stated, these pens have been around for almost ever

6: Didn't like it at first but had to adjust after using so many 'bad' pens
