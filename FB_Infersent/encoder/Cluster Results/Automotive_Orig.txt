2: I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks
3: for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do
4: With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly
5: I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach
6: I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off

4: 5' F150 truck bed perfectly

3: Enjoy
4: K
5: ,
6: LOL
7: keep looking
8: A+++++++++++++
9: Thanks

Cluster 9:
1: I even use it to secure a line of grocery bags on the ride home from the market
2: it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it
3: Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home
4: It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there

Cluster 10:
1: very nice
2: Great product, works real well
3: The one works ok
4: This is much better
5: This is great
6: This one works great every time
7: Other than that, it works perfectly
8: work great

Cluster 11:
1: You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click
2: Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly
3: When it is tightened it just pops off the gear and will not create enough tension to hold in place
4: Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on and it took forever to get right and didn't seem to hold as well
5: will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can and it still will not hole very good
6: Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point
7: Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to
8: Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening
9: just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release

Cluster 12:
1: The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position
2: The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable
3: My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling
4: I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling
5: I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!
6: Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first
7: If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two)
8: Which would in my opinon make this system useless for my needs

Cluster 13:
1: So petty, I know
2: I received it fast, works as advertised
3: Won't work for what I had in mind for it
4: Just what I was looking for
5: I ordered two
6: I would recommend
7: The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted
8: now I need a topper!

Cluster 14:
1: I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money
2: No regrets from me on this purchase
3: Will not hold in place
4: It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile
5: It has not failed me yet
6: Never had a problem with it slipping or not unlocking or anything
7: It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it
8: The device is not worth it

Cluster 15:
1: Seems to be built very well too
2: It has worked well since being put in place
3: it is still in place and working
4: Easy to install, has worked well so far
5: Stays in place very well
6: They work just as described
7: This seems to work fine so far

Cluster 16:
1: I received the order promptly but the ratcheting device did not function as well as I had expected
2: The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked
3: So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds
4: My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy
5: The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place
6: The locking mechanism simply would not hold

Cluster 17:
1: The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust
2: This thing was a steal for $25 and free shipping
3: Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby
4: Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada
5: Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one
6: The product is cheaply made and would not stay locked in place on the desired adjustment
7: We returned the item and paid more for a better made product he found in a store
8: I bought a more expensive one and returned it
9: Waste of time and money! If the mech was closer to one side this would be a great product!
10: This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years
11: It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity
12: If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there
13: This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product
14: When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced
15: Missing a screw at one end now I have to go to store and find one to fit! Packing should have been better
16: You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk

Cluster 18:
1: I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed
2: My husband ordered this to keep his ice chest from sliding in the back of his work truck (full-size Chevrolet)
3: The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless
4: When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck
5: I am just about 6 feet tall and I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck
6: You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed
7: This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed
8: I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup
9: Great for keeping the ice chest at the back of the truck
10: I bought this cargo bar in a hurry to keep our coolers and gas cans in place during our 800 mile death valley off road adventure

Cluster 19:
1: Fits in any location and allows you to store equipment securely
2: My husband asked for a similar item as a gift but I wanted to see reviews so I shopped Amazon
3: It is of high quality and held my cargo in the bed of my truck from Colorado to Southern California
4: Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering
5: A bit of screwing around and you'll master it
6: The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly
7: I don't know how good this product will be on holding back heavy items, but it works well on garden flowers they all stead in place with this bar
8: I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate
9: I bought this, and it will not stay where I put it, and Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!
10: I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product
11: Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED
12: Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed!
13: Defective ratchet
14: Perhaps I just got a lemon
15: His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle)
16: You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars
17: I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed
18: I would be on the fence to recommend this product
19: Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box
20: I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star
21: I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks
22: Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy
23: It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much
24: I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O
25: as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate
26: This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks
27: In my opinion a good value as well
28: i tok this item to my SUV, its defict the plastic internal
29: Cargo bar will not tighten tight enough to hold its self up let alone holding cargo
30: It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home
31: My advice is to just be careful or wear gloves while adjusting it
32: Open your box ASAP
33: This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
34: This bar is pretty flimsy and difficult to release it will not hold anything stable that has any weight to it
35: Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady
36: Performs exactly as expected
37: If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set
38: The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly
39: Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet
40: I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works
41: Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out
42: Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it
43: Ends were open
44: If you are looking for a heavy duty piece of equipment
45: BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight and simple this may be a good choice
46: Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy
47: These cargo bars fit it perfectly - no complaints with the quality or operation after a winter of holding cargo
48: Just received it for Christmas
49: The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place
50: It provides a sturdy anchor for my cargo bed contents and will hold a mower right where you want it
51: Spreads and retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner
52: Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC and back
53: That leaves me without a tailgate
54: Lets hope this second one lives up to it's potential
55: Keeps it from sliding around and breaking my fishing rods :-)
56: Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about
57: Lots of bumps and jumps and still works like a champ
58: I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded and difficult to extend constently
59: I was disappointed in the bar diameter and overall durability
60: After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did
61: Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move
62: (No staying-put power)I will try the twist type system next
63: New Hampshire
64: Excellent deal!!  Would buy more if needed more

Cluster 20:
1: Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly
2: The ratchet part works great
3: This thing is heavy duty and works excellent
4: Also the finish seems to be good quality
5: A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality
6: The ratchet part is very well made
7: The quality is there,  and the ratchet works very well
8: It is made of good quality material and workmanship

Cluster 21:
1: Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out
2: It did slip once while I was adjusting last click
3: It is to late to get a replacement
4: I didn't open the box until I needed them
5: Back in the box and the return process started within 15 min of receiving it
6: I had to return one already because it broke
7: Just as I expected it held in place the entire trip and it got abused
8: It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly

Cluster 22:
1: This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected
2: The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew)
3: It's worth the money paid and I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed
4: This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use
5: I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine
6: So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler
7: I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point
8: This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks)
9: Been a great cargo bar, I use it for holding plastic bins in place in the bed of my truck and so far it has worked great and has never budged unless I have removed it intentionally
10: Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything

Cluster 23:
1: The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened
2: The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place
3: I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells
4: At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls
5: I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension
6: I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar
7: The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer) and consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls

Cluster 24:
1: if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar
2: When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance
3: This bar is easy to adjust and the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly
4: The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center
5: I wanted a strong ratchet type bar and this is exactly it
6: The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds
7: The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other
8: If your moving anything heavy don't count on this bar
9: Could only achieve tension to hold bar in place in certain spots
10: When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit and jump a detent on the ratchet bar

Cluster 25:
1: This was more sturdy and fit my needs better
2: I was expecting something more sturdy
3: I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight
4: So it's sturdy enough to take a beating

Cluster 26:
1: Good construction, use it as a cargo separator under my tonneau cover
2: The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs
3: The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps
4: It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider
5: This looks like a high quality cargo bar, but on the 2nd use, the ratcheting function broke
6: Fit great into my S10 and secures very well using the ratchet mechanism
7: However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate
8: Product is just as described, works just like a ratchet strap

Cluster 27:
1: Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks
2: When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space
3: I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed
4: the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck
5: I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason

Cluster 28:
1: Much needed tool for anyone that has a truck
2: So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck
3: i geass its good for truck only because its metel internal
4: Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove
5: This is a must have for pickup truck owners

Cluster 29:
1: It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards
2: Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis
3: No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product
4: You can tell by the feel and weight that it's cheap, but it does what it's suppose to
5: It may function to restrain small light items but not much more
6: For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded
7: I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure
8: You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving
9: Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps
10: So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

Cluster 30:
1: Good Cargo Bar
2: The cargo bar is great

6: I have had no problems with it
7: ) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it
8: Have had no problems at all
9: It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this
10: I haven't had any problems with it, but it's a little difficult to get it to release some times

Cluster 35:
1: I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon
2: Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in
3: When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep
4: After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place
5: But with this Ratchet Cargo Bar, I can still through things, but I can now through them in the right place
6: Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world
7: After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it
8: This is  the first ratcheting cargo bar that I have had and I recomend it highly very easy to adjust and the ratchet action makes it very easy to use

6: I have a screw type one and it is a pain
7: My Ranger has one of those useless and unattractive narrow beds
8: Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak

Cluster 38:
1: I have a bed cover on and it makes it easier to carry stuff from the store without having the stuff slide forward
2: easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it
3: This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall
4: It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed

Cluster 39:
1: I purchase this item several weeks ago and it works as advertised
2: Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use
3: I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out
