Cluster 0:
1: Works fine most of the time, blobs out ink other times, but hey, GREAT PRICE, and I've lost half of them already, so who cares?
2: They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within
3: We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens, with the white barrel, medium or fine points
4: It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color
5: The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white
6: The Cristal pens have a wider point or something, even though these are both labeled as medium points

Cluster 1:
1: They go through a lot of pens - customers take them, bussers toss them, they drop them, etc
2: What can one say about these pens? They're about the most basic pens imaginable
3: But, I think the pen would benefit a lot more if they added a grip to it
4: These pens are fine if used sooner else it gets harder and a little rough to use
5: As far as pens go, these are perfect for having around when you need one, but don't care when you misplace/lose it
6: While these are not the type of pens you would want to write with for a long period of time, they are a great buy
7: If you pull a pen from the box, it will write, and it will write smoothly
8: These would be great for any environment that consumes a lot of pens

Cluster 2:
1: Anyway Amazon was kind enough to refund me the $4
2: Arrived promptly and as described
3: I would buy again and recommend to others

5: We will order again
6: would buy again and again
7: Checked Amazon and of course the had them
8: Will definitely purchase again when they all disppear as pens often do

Cluster 3:
1: I am making sporadic edits to a paper with these pieces of trash and they can't even make it from the top of the page to the bottom
2: They seem to dry/clog up instantly, and it is impossible to maintain a train of thought with there constant ineptitude, grinding the gears to a halt
3: What's worse is that once one of these pestilent pens calls it quits, there's nothing you can do with the abomination except throw it away
4: Thus, the cheaply made pen is purchased at an inflated rate, performs cheaply, and then makes it's most prominent impact on the world--not as a writing device, but as another poisonous piece of plastic, sent to join a landfill or float in an ocean: either way, rotting the earth
5: The Bic Round Stic pen is the cancer that keeps on giving; I wouldn't wish this junk product on my worst enemy, and I encourage anyone interested in giving this shameful company any money for this, or another, disposable piece of garbage to strongly reconsider and fork up the extra dough to purchase something that is made with actual quality
6: There are a lot of places these pens can be shoved, but they only belong in one dark, smelly hole--and it ain't a landfill

Cluster 4:
1: These do not work well, cheaply made
2: The color is almost a pink instead of a nice red
3: The ink is very scant and light colored

7: I used them at work and they almost always worked
8: They write well
9: They do actually write every time for me

Cluster 7:
1: The design is simple and the cap nicely fits both the ink-side the end-side
2: Some pen caps don't really fit the end, so you end up losing the cap
3: There isn't much to say about these pens, but the cap being able to fit nicely at the end is a plus
4: They're light and come with a cap
5: The caps were extremely hard to pull off
6: The caps go on and off easily with minimal force
7: That ish is tackyOh, and Gloria will chew the pen caps off no matter what
8: The clip on the caps however make it hard to attach to the lapel or shirt

Cluster 8:
1: i use these for ccdw classes and havent had a problem yet
2: Bic never disappoints!! As I've stated before I am a college student and I don't have time to be running out of things so bulk is better for me and Bic has never disappointed me
3: Well, after losing money on pens that I bought in the 12pk and handed out but were never returned, I began to use my head instead of my purse
4: I think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems!  This is usually one product on which you can count, to not leak all over the place and still write nicely, and for a long time
5: which often happens, I am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them
6: Like another reviewer here, I am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame
7: I will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location, to save money I presume, I certainly did not see the price of these things, cheap though they  may be, going down any, for us, the consumer
8: Excellent product, quality, nice-looking and i dont have any bad comment for this product, it just what I was looking for

3: I have found that even I have trouble loosing these things if I buy them a dozen at a time
4: but what are you going to do?  I guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter

6: I keep losing them though, which makes me have to keep buying more
7: Warning: if you have a ton of pens, people will just steal them quicker

Cluster 20:
1: spent a whole 10 bucks :) and I just threw these bastards arround the house on every drawer on every corner, everywhere
2: I have also noted that some classes and some students will actually try to take advantage of a substitute teacher and their third favorite request the instant the bell rings is "can I go to my locker
3: I have the little twerps! And I don't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests
4: As an additional advantage, I do not mind writing short notes with them myself, and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk
5: I buy a big box of pens and keep some at home, in kitchen, by computer, books, in my bag, a few to give and forget aboutwhen someone asks to "borrow a pen",
6: They taste great with a little garlic butter and tomato sauce over pasta
7: Great price, came quickly - so many pens leftover from my project (handing them out at a booth) that I'll be set for pens for a while :)
8: I love the fact that 10 pens allows several throughout the house so they're always available when you need it - especially by the phones with a pad
9: You can even fling the pen caps! I love these pens but whatever you do, don't put them in the freezer

3: I gave these to friends in a Nursing Home to write their life stories in!  Those who are writing their stories are having a good time remimicing
4: These pens will serve your check book well (does anyone still use those things? I do, but I'm old school like that), take great notes in school, and scribble a quick note at your desk without fuss
5: This is great school supplies value for Middle School and High School students who need pens but sometimes lose them in their daily shuffle
6: What a good deal, with prime! Enough pens to keep my volleyball team writing away on their statistics sheets for a couple season, hopefully
7: These pens are the best!  They last a long time, too!  I will be using them mostly for school and my business
8: They write well enough for daily needs and if your work environment is anything like mine you'll start to find your lost pens all over the place

Cluster 26:
1: If you're into blue ball point pens, this is where its at
2: This red pen is SWEET! would highly recommond to someone looking for this, only downside is it could be  bigger~
3: Overall a good buy, although for some reason the black was not available which is what most people like, but the blue is fine, too
4: These pens are blue
5: They're basic and blue which is what you expect when you're buying these
6: If you want a basic blue ballpoint, this is it
7: Also had them in black and red, so ordered 2 blues and one black and one red
8: Unless you prefer black ink, then keep moving (but I am sure BIC makes a lovely black pen as well)

Cluster 27:
1: I wasn't looking for the best writing pen so much as I was the best price
2: 00, well you bet I love the price

2: I have used at least 20 of them so far & have yet to come across one that doesn't work well
3: Now, I'm not as concerned with whether, or not, I get the pens back because replacing them doesn't cost me an arm and a leg
4: Your basic pen in a high enough quantity that you don't mind if a few dozen go missing
5: 60 pens in one box for a low price! I haven't used all the pens so far, but what I've used and given away worked without problems
6: I obviously have not tested all 60 of them, but all the ones I have used so far have made nice, smooth, even lines
7: Except that they work, even after sitting long periods of time!  I haven't had a single issue with any of these pens
8: Didn't like it at first but had to adjust after using so many 'bad' pens
9: Even if you lost a pen every few days there's enough here to keep you happy for a while
10: The item was entirely wrapped in tape, precluding the possibility of being unintentionally opened, and promptly arrived in less than three days of ordering

Cluster 29:
1: Best little pen I ever had

3: Perhaps, they just can't take the owner!Anyway, I got these in bulk

7: These are good pens

Cluster 31:
1: If your looking for cheap then this is what you need to get, If your looking for fancy and attractive this is not it for you
2: I'm sure every one has used normal bic pens before, they are exactly the same as the one you normally used
3: You get what you pay for
4: But to hand out to clients that will not return, it's perfect, that was we don't lose our better pens
5: If you don't use them for several months, you'll find that several pens do not actually write at all and you will need to throw them away
6: I needed pens for work as mine are always being stolen
7: I can loan them out and if they don't come back to me I am not out alot of money
8: Gets two stars because they're cheap and you could leave them out at a business and people wouldn't be very tempted to take them home

Cluster 32:
1: I personally don't mind  using them, I live with a few people in my house and my pens tend to get lost  quite often
2: I tend to lose a lot of pens before they run out of ink, so can't speak to how long they'll last, but I'm sure i'll be buying these again once i lose all 60 again
3: these bic pens are great pens which come in a neatly designed box i use these pens in my business for customers to sign their receipts and work orders they last and work well
4: Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly
5: I like the new design and how comfortable they are to write with, but only annoyance is that the caps are SO hard to pull off initially!!  I had to keep twisting and tugging on the caps of all of the pens I've used to far
6: Great many for the price and great for classroom use! My students are always excited to get to use a pen
7: I use them in my classroom (I teach high school) as they are cheaper than most pencils and pens out there
8: good  pens don't love how ya have to pull off the cap instead of click it open but they write well

Cluster 33:
1: Recommended
2: Awesome
3: Otherwise, they're perfect!
4: word
5: Completeley recommended
6: gross
7: they explode!

Cluster 34:
1: These are decent quality and an awesome price
2: actually several reasons
3: First they are quite inexpensive
4: Third they are available anywhere
5: but that is for another review)
6: These BICs have superb action
7: They are very functional for the price
8: These are just basic pens, nothing special
9: bic is a name to trust
10: They didn't have them
11: 10/pen, these are absolutely a steal

Cluster 35:
1: comfortable in your hand but i was surprised how well the ink comes out and write, for dirt cheap pens I love the way they look and feel
2: Great cheap item so far every pen i have used has worked first try i would recommend buy this alot of pen for a great cheap price
3: People lose pens all the time and these are so inexpensive that I don't feel bad constantly giving out new ones like I have to do anyway
4: These are your basic every day pens that are so darn cheap you don't much care when they grow their legs and disappear on you
5: I don't like to pay an extreme price for pens but i expect them to work
6: I manage a small business and have a great need of pens, to save money I was buying cheap pens but luckily got these
7: For the price and all I wasn't expecting much but these pens work great right out of the box
8: Comfortable to write with and priced cheap enough that losing them isn't too much of a bummer

Cluster 36:
1: Bic Pens: from plain (like these) to "fancy", they write, they write, they write -- they are inexpensive, seem to last a looong time, and create GREAT multiple copies because you press em as hard as you want and they write, they write, they write
2: 36 pens with 2-day Amazon Prime delivery? Yes please! Seriously though, these are just what you expect: good old Bic ball point pens
3: I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably, sure as the sun rises, there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil (I always keep several packages of pencils too
4: So why buy a box of 60 pens, when it takes forever just to use up a single pen?There are lots of reasons, the biggest being the well known fact that once you set a pen down and look away they grow legs and walk off
5: I would say that there are maybe 1-2 duds per pack of 60, but it was the cheapest pen I could find online, and much more reliable than freebie promotional pens
6: So, the Bic Round Stick Pen Medium Point is a nice little pen!They&#8217;re not fancy, but I was tired of paying $4 for a 2-pen set from Walgreens/CVS/The Local Grocer and such and decided to go ahead and try these as they came 60 in a box&#8230; And so basically for pennies on the dollar I have enough pens that should last myself and my relatives (as they always seem to borrow my work supplies&#8230;) well throughout the year!They work fine, come with caps and so far have not bled out in my bag like some other cheaper pens of the past
7: So, if you just want something to write with that doesn&#8217;t have to come with the bells and whistles of a personalized gold pen, or say a calligraphy pen set, then I think anyone would be satisfied with this offering from the folks at Bic
8: five stars for the price, i got them very cheap;  with four  kids that use pens often  and loose them even more often the price was awesome; will be buying more later
9: i was needing some basic  ink pens the bic did the trick  they are good ink pens  if you need basic writeing pens theses pen,s will do it
10: I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use
11: I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!
12: If you want to have enough of a nice normal no fuss pen that writes smoothly to get through the zombie apocalypse, if you need to get a crowd jotting things down or if you have to keep a stash of pens because you are surrounded by office supplies thieves then this is the affordable pack of lovely blue pens for you

Cluster 37:
1: 69, making each pen cost about 8 cents, which is a satisfying price
2: This package, as an 'add-on' item, cost under 10 cents per pen so I ordered two and took them in
3: At the time of this review this box of 60 pens is only 54 cents higher in cost than buying a 10 pack on Amazon
4: So for 54 cents you get 50 more pens, that's an obviously fantastic deal
5: 6 (7 if you round) cents a pen

Cluster 38:
1: Great deal on a lot of ink pens
2: Hands down, best product for this kind of money, I was tired of never finding pens, so I bought three boxes of these
3: I'm a happy man
4: We play a lot of group games, which means we need a lot of pens, and that a lot of those pens walk off
5: Great value!  Price is hard to beat
6: Prices seem to vary on this product, so I'd suggest browsing through the various sizes/colors to find the current best deal
7: Bic are my favorite pens, as they write despite the weather or time stored
8: I have taken these overseas for storage and use in our bookstore and they always work
9: Even the Africans ask for these by name
10: Product wise, all 44 pens tested working, able to write smoothly
11: I bought this pens to be used as &#34;expendables&#34; actually, and they really fit thr bill
12: 60 for $5
13: I have several friends who are servers at my favorite restaurant
14: BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they don't mind putting them down with credit card receipts
15: Used to purchase pens from costco and sams club but they wouldn't write on paper when written on top of glass
16: these bic pens always work the best and the blue was just cheaper but is more vibrant color so works out well when signing paperwork
17: I think they have legs and just run away after awhile
18: Why on earth?  Bic, you need to come back home to make these
19: Good quality pen at the right price!
20: I find the medium size is bold enough to see without being in optimum light
21: The cost of each pen is great, I don't mind lending these to someone that needs one
22: Not the smoothest pen, nor the most comfortable to hold, but if you can get this at less than a dime per pen, it's a great value
23: There of course is a reason for this
24: I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff
25: "  Ha
26: Won't need to buy any pens for a while
27: I bought a couple of these for my smaller ambulance corp and they work great
28: They last pretty long for the harsh use they go through, the ink doesn't wash off with rain or water, and they even seem to write well in harsh conditions
29: We use them to write orders for food in our restaurant
30: WE don't use expensive pens because they walk away
31: They won't win any beauty contests, but they do put ink on paper, and they do it cheaply
32: Other than that, these are perfectly adequate and the price really can't be beat
33: &#34;  You get items for the price you pay
34: good price
35: ink came first time the pen was used
36: no more to say about this pen
37: I will buy all ball pens in amazon in the future
38: Okay lets be serious now
39: Everyday pens for everyday people
40: BIC lives up to their expectation - their slogan is &#34;writes the first time, every time&#34;
41: very true
42: used them during a graduation party for the guests
