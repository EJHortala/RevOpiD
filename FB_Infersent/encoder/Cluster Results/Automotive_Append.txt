Cluster 0:
1: Doesn't get excessively tight in my truck (thus the 4 stars)
2: I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed
3: Perfect for keeping stuff from sliding around the bed of a truck during normal driving
4: Worked well in my truck bed with bedliner and camper shell
5: Great for keeping the ice chest at the back of the truck
6: Keeps it from sliding around and breaking my fishing rods :-)
7: I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed

Cluster 1:
1: Guess where it ends up when you try to use it? In the middle of the bed
2: So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck
3: I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out
4: Perhaps I just got a lemon
5: Won't work for what I had in mind for it
6: I might be able to find something it will work with
7: I would recommend trying a different cargo bar
8: I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off
9: (No staying-put power)I will try the twist type system next

Cluster 2:
1: This was more sturdy and fit my needs better
2: I was expecting something more sturdy
3: When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced
4: I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure
5: I was disappointed in the bar diameter and overall durability
6: I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight
7: Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first
8: If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two)
9: So it's sturdy enough to take a beating
10: However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate
11: Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move

Cluster 3:
1: This looks like a high quality cargo bar, but on the 2nd use, the ratcheting function broke
2: The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked
3: The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center
4: When it is tightened it just pops off the gear and will not create enough tension to hold in place
5: will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can and it still will not hole very good
6: Cargo bar will not tighten tight enough to hold its self up let alone holding cargo
7: Ratchet unit slips when you put a load on it
8: The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place
9: It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it
10: The locking mechanism simply would not hold
11: Could only achieve tension to hold bar in place in certain spots

Cluster 4:
1: The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust
2: The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened
3: Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly
4: Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks
5: Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby
6: Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada
7: Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one
8: I bought a more expensive one and returned it
9: Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on and it took forever to get right and didn't seem to hold as well
10: It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity
11: as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate
12: So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler
13: I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason
14: I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded and difficult to extend constently
15: This is  the first ratcheting cargo bar that I have had and I recomend it highly very easy to adjust and the ratchet action makes it very easy to use
16: Excellent deal!!  Would buy more if needed more

Cluster 5:
1: Highly recommend

Cluster 7:

2: It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider

1: Fits in any location and allows you to store equipment securely
2: Might break a weld on the inside of your bed

4: My husband asked for a similar item as a gift but I wanted to see reviews so I shopped Amazon
5: It is of high quality and held my cargo in the bed of my truck from Colorado to Southern California
6: I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered
7: I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon
8: I purchase this item several weeks ago and it works as advertised
9: The ratchet part works great
10: I don't know how good this product will be on holding back heavy items, but it works well on garden flowers they all stead in place with this bar
11: very nice
12: Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use
13: the shipping time was less than expected
14: Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED
15: His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle)
16: I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine
17: I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks
18: It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much
19: It may function to restrain small light items but not much more
20: I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O
21: i tok this item to my SUV, its defict the plastic internal
22: i geass its good for truck only because its metel internal
23: I have already pinched my fingers in it several times and have only owned it for about 3 weeks
24: This bar is pretty flimsy and difficult to release it will not hold anything stable that has any weight to it
25: I should've had one these years ago
26: This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product
27: A bit weak but the price is cheap
28: If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set
29: I am happy with my purchase for sure
30: ) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it
31: Missing a screw at one end now I have to go to store and find one to fit! Packing should have been better
32: My Ranger has one of those useless and unattractive narrow beds
33: These cargo bars fit it perfectly - no complaints with the quality or operation after a winter of holding cargo
34: Just received it for Christmas
35: Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak
36: Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC and back
37: Back in the box and the return process started within 15 min of receiving it
38: It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this
39: Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about
40: It is made of good quality material and workmanship
41: After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did

Cluster 9:
1: I would buy this again
2: So petty, I know
3: I would absolutely purchase again
4: Just what I was looking for
5: I would recommend

4: Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it

4: K
5: ,
6: This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
7: LOL
8: A+++++++++++++
9: Thanks

Cluster 14:
1: The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew)
2: I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed
3: The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless
4: This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks)
5: Spreads and retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner
6: Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything

Cluster 15:
1: I ordered two
2: One is broken
3: Open your box ASAP
4: The one works ok
5: A little on the flimsy side
6: keep looking
7: Just crank down on it

Cluster 16:
1: Much needed tool for anyone that has a truck
2: This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds
3: This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed
4: Holds things very securely in the bed of the truck
5: 5' F150 truck bed perfectly
6: It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner
7: Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove
8: This is a must have for pickup truck owners

Cluster 17:
1: The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs
2: The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps
3: Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly
4: I wanted a strong ratchet type bar and this is exactly it
5: The ratchet part is very well made
6: The quality is there,  and the ratchet works very well
7: Fit great into my S10 and secures very well using the ratchet mechanism
8: Product is just as described, works just like a ratchet strap

Cluster 18:
1: Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr
2: Super value
3: a good value for the cost
4: Would buy again!
5: The price is right too
6: This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost
7: I'd buy it again
8: Outstanding price
9: definitely worth the price

Cluster 19:
1: Holds things inplace, and very easy to use
2: The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly
3: This bar is easy to adjust and the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly
4: Easy to snap in and take out
5: It is easy to use and stays in place without damage
6: It is really easy to adjust and move around
7: It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely
8: The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place

Cluster 20:
1: My husband ordered this to keep his ice chest from sliding in the back of his work truck (full-size Chevrolet)
2: When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck
3: I am just about 6 feet tall and I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck
4: You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed
5: it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it
6: I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point
7: the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck
8: I received the cargo bar and installed on my truck
9: I was buying for my jeep cherokee for when I lower the back seat for storage
10: When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit and jump a detent on the ratchet bar

Cluster 21:
1: I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed
2: I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells
3: At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls
4: I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension
5: Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box
6: I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar
7: just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release

Cluster 22:
1: I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it
2: If your moving anything heavy don't count on this bar
3: I do not recommend this cargo bar
4: I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar
5: I would recommend you keep looking for a sturdier cargo bar
6: This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place

Cluster 23:
1: It's useless now
2: Defective ratchet
3: Will not hold in place
4: This product is trash
5: Ends were open
6: This item was horrible
7: The device is not worth it
8: Keeper 05059 Ratcheting Cargo BarSorry  Will S

Cluster 24:

5: You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars
6: If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it
7: Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one

Cluster 25:
1: I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!
2: I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his
3: I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup and worked great
4: If you are like me, I just through items in the back of my truck and hope they are still there wherever I'm going
5: But with this Ratchet Cargo Bar, I can still through things, but I can now through them in the right place
6: Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world
7: After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it
8: Just as I expected it held in place the entire trip and it got abused

Cluster 26:
1: only had the for short time but I do like them
2: I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me
3: Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed!
4: You can tell by the feel and weight that it's cheap, but it does what it's suppose to
5: The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position
6: It's a bit tricky to get used too
7: My advice is to just be careful or wear gloves while adjusting it
8: My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling
9: I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling
10: I haven't had any problems with it, but it's a little difficult to get it to release some times
11: I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!
12: So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

Cluster 27:
1: This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected
2: It's worth the money paid and I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed
3: This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use
4: I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate
5: I have a bed cover on and it makes it easier to carry stuff from the store without having the stuff slide forward
6: easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it
7: It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed
8: This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed
9: It provides a sturdy anchor for my cargo bed contents and will hold a mower right where you want it
10: Been a great cargo bar, I use it for holding plastic bins in place in the bed of my truck and so far it has worked great and has never budged unless I have removed it intentionally
11: I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup
12: I bought this cargo bar in a hurry to keep our coolers and gas cans in place during our 800 mile death valley off road adventure

Cluster 28:
1: It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards
2: When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space
3: Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis
4: For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded
5: You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving
6: Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps

Cluster 29:
1: Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out
2: You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click
3: It did slip once while I was adjusting last click
4: After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext
5: So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds
6: No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product
7: My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy
8: Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to

Cluster 30:
1: I received the order promptly but the ratcheting device did not function as well as I had expected
2: The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place
3: This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall
4: The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly
5: The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer) and consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls
6: Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point
7: Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening

Cluster 31:
1: The bar feels solid
2: One high, one low
3: Stays in place very well
4: It was okay, but cumbersome
5: Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady
6: Keeps my load in place
7: It fits my 6
8: Once secured in place it stays there
9: They work just as described
10: That leaves me without a tailgate
11: Easy to use, stays locked tight
12: My cargo held tight

Cluster 32:
1: This one had one of the best reviews and so far it doing the job
2: Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering
3: The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging
4: I have been using it and it works very well
5: that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them
6: Easy to install, has worked well so far

8: Great item , best one I have ever used
9: I just love shopping at Amazon,because they have so many great merchants
10: The shipping speed was terrific and the product was awesome thank you very much!!see you soon!
11: I have been using this for almost a year now and it works great
12: I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works
13: I am very pleased with them, and I recommend them highly
14: What can I say just a perfect design works excellent

Cluster 33:
1: It's one of those you get what you pay for
2: It is to late to get a replacement
3: I didn't open the box until I needed them
4: It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly
5: So please get familiar with it before you need it
6: After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one

Cluster 34:
1: if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar
2: Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in
3: When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep
4: I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks
5: After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place
6: The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds
7: The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other

Cluster 35:
1: The product is cheaply made and would not stay locked in place on the desired adjustment
2: We returned the item and paid more for a better made product he found in a store
3: I bought this, and it will not stay where I put it, and Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!
4: Waste of time and money! If the mech was closer to one side this would be a great product!
5: This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years
6: I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350
7: Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy
8: You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk
9: Which would in my opinon make this system useless for my needs

Cluster 36:
1: Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months
2: Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain
3: Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado
4: It works great on my Ford Ranger pickup
5: I have a Ford F150
6: I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab

9: It works well on my '07 Tacoma
10: I drive a 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty
11: This product works very well and stores behind the seat of my Chevy Colorado pickup
12: It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab

Cluster 37:
1: I would recommend them to a friend
2: I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product
3: Easy to use and racheting works good
4: I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time
5: I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper
6: I would be on the fence to recommend this product
7: I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star
8: would recommend it to friends  it is  great
9: A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality
10: BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight and simple this may be a good choice
11: Lets hope this second one lives up to it's potential
12: I would highly recommend this to anybody

Cluster 38:
1: Tightened down a bit and it was secure
2: it is still in place and working
3: It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile
4: Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy
5: Performs exactly as expected
6: Other than that, it works perfectly
7: This seems to work fine so far

Cluster 39:
1: A bit of screwing around and you'll master it
2: When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance
3: If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there
4: for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do
5: With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly
6: The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable
7: I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach
8: I have a screw type one and it is a pain
9: Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet
10: Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out
11: Lots of bumps and jumps and still works like a champ
