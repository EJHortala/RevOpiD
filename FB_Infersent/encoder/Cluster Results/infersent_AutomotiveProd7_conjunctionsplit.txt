1. Good construction, use it as a cargo separator under my tonneau cover
2. It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider
3. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time
4. find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box
5. matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar
6. If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it

Cluster 2_pos:
1. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds
2. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile
3. For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded
4. Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps

Cluster 2_neg:
1. would not stay locked in place on the desired adjustment
2. The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked
3. it will not stay where I put it,
4. will not create enough tension to hold in place
5. will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can
6. it still will not hole very good
7. difficult to release it will not hold anything stable that has any weight to it
8. It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it
9. The locking mechanism simply would not hold

1. When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space
2. lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected
3. I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed
4. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy
5. This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks)
6. Been a great cargo bar, I use it for holding plastic bins in place in the bed of my truck
7. I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup
8. Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it
9. It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there

Cluster 6_neg:
1. The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew)
2. I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed
3. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck

1. Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering
2. Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews
3. If I had to think of a weakness
4. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product
5. Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed!
6. If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable,
7. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it
8. fit my needs better
9. You can tell by the feel
10. weight that it's cheap, but it does what it's suppose to
11. I was expecting something more sturdy
12. seems to have plenty of strength
13. My advice is to just be careful
14. for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do
15. I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how -
16. to what - it might attach
17. I have a screw type one
18. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling
19. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic
20. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling
21. requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly
22. I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works
23. fits my need as was hoped for
24. If you are looking for a heavy duty piece of equipment
25. BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight
26. Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak
27. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about
28. just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning
29. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!
30. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down
31. even give you a pinch (or two)
32. So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

5. I might be able to find something it will work with

4. I have had no problems with it
5. It has not failed me yet

7. I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it

9. seller
10. definitely worth the price

Cluster 14_neg:

Cluster 15_pos:
1. You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click
2. Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short
3. Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks
4. I received the order promptly but the ratcheting device did not function as well as I had expected
5. thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension
6. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in
7. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep
8. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead
9. The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position
10. I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason
11. Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point
12. I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure
13. Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to
14. it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release

19. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband,

22. I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!
23. I bought a more expensive one
24. Enjoy
25. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard
26. I don't know how good this product will be on holding back heavy items, but it works well on garden flowers they all stead in place with this bar
27. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use

46. Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now,
47. No slipping
48. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star
49. when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made
50. Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy
51. It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much
52. It may function to restrain small light items but not much more
53. adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed
54. I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline
55. it was O
56. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate
57. This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks
58. In my opinion a good value as well
59. The shipping speed was terrific
60. It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home
61. I have already pinched my fingers in it several times
62. The price is right too
63. Open your box ASAP
64. uninstalling - quickly
65. So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly,
66. doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler
67. The result was an incessant flopping back
68. This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
69. This one works great every time
70. This is only a minor issue
71. If your moving anything heavy don't count on this bar
72. It fits my 6
73. When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced
74. I do not recommend this cargo bar
75. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet
76. This thing is heavy duty
77. The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted
78. LOL
79. It was very easy to install (old lady here)
80. Arrived as promissed
81. A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality

89. will hold a mower right where you want it
90. Very useful
91. dependable
92. camper shell
93. hope they are still there wherever I'm going
94. But with this Ratchet Cargo Bar, I can still through things, but I can now through them in the right place
95. Great Product
96. Spreads
97. Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC
98. Just crank down on it
99. That leaves me without a tailgate
100. Lets hope this second one lives up to it's potential
101. Great for keeping the ice chest at the back of the truck
102. am not sure if other bars do this
103. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about
104. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening
105. Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world
106. Easy to use, stays locked tight
107. After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit
108. lone behold its still right where I left it
109. My cargo held tight
110. fast shipping
111. jumps
112. I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded
113. What can I say just a perfect design works excellent
114. the ratchet works very well
115. hard to learn at first
116. workmanship
117. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating
118. Fit great into my S10
119. came back to buy another one
120. After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar
121. Its lighter
122. easier to install
123. Excellent deal!!  Would buy more if needed more

3. The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate,
4. The ratchet part works great
5. My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy
6. The ratcheting mechanism is very rough
7. The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer)
8. The ratchet part is very well made
9. the ratchet action makes it very easy to use
10. secures very well using the ratchet mechanism
11. the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate
12. Product is just as described, works just like a ratchet strap

Cluster 20_neg:
1. weak the ratchet is also a weak point
2. The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place

Cluster 21_pos:
1. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened
2. stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells
3. At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls
4. I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly
5. puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it
6. This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall
7. This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed
8. consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls
9. retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner

Cluster 21_neg:

Cluster 22_pos:
1. allows you to store equipment securely
2. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great
3. Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing
4. Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada
5. it makes it easier to carry stuff from the store without having the stuff slide forward
6. It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range
7. I even use it to secure a line of grocery bags on the ride home from the market
8. I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup
9. If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set

Cluster 28_pos:
1. if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar
2. When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance
3. the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly
4. I wanted a strong ratchet type bar
5. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds
6. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give

Cluster 28_neg:
1. When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck
2. The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center
3. When it is tightened it just pops off the gear
4. When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit
5. jump a detent on the ratchet bar

Cluster 29_pos:
1. you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place
2. it took forever to get right
3. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one
4. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click
5. It is to late to get a replacement
6. I didn't open the box until I needed them
7. With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing
8. I had to return one already because it broke
9. Just as I expected it held in place the entire trip
10. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly
11. So please get familiar with it before you need it

Cluster 29_neg:
1. I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon
2. Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!
