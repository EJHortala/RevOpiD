Similar to review 1 - Much needed tool for anyone that has a truck. Fits in any location and allows you to store equipment securely. :
1. 0.831789 This is a must have for pickup truck owners.  The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place.  The ratchet part is very well made.  You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving.  Have had no problems at all.....
2. 0.816134 This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.
3. 0.814478 Easy to snap in and take out.  Holds things very securely in the bed of the truck.  Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis.
4. 0.813225 This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
5. 0.813005 This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed.It,however,is a low cost,durable multi use product.I bought two of these and use them to support my slide-out on my Lance truck camper when extended.It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity.Highly recommend this product.

Similar to review 2 - I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust. :
1. 0.92703 I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
2. 0.923309 Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
3. 0.914226 Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.
4. 0.913214 Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
5. 0.910508 I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

Similar to review 3 - Good Cargo Bar.  Doesn't get excessively tight in my truck (thus the 4 stars).  Good construction, use it as a cargo separator under my tonneau cover. :

3. 0.857774 I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...

Similar to review 4 - This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds. The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs. The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened. :

3. 0.90314 Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.

5. 0.899744 When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced.  The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly.  I do not recommend this cargo bar.

Similar to review 5 - Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months. It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider. You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click. Might break a weld on the inside of your bed.This thing was a steal for $25 and free shipping. :
