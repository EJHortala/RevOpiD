Similar to review 1 - Much needed tool for anyone that has a truck :
1. 0.732145 So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck
2. 0.726641 This is a must have for pickup truck owners
3. 0.712966 Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks
4. 0.706532 it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it
5. 0.70184 Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home

Similar to review 2 - Fits in any location and allows you to store equipment securely :
1. 0.701424 If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set
2. 0.701279 I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells
3. 0.696342 This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use
4. 0.692021 This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place
5. 0.689671 It provides a sturdy anchor for my cargo bed contents and will hold a mower right where you want it

Similar to review 3 - I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed :
1. 0.841575 This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected
2. 0.832641 The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew)
3. 0.832413 This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed
4. 0.830077 Been a great cargo bar, I use it for holding plastic bins in place in the bed of my truck and so far it has worked great and has never budged unless I have removed it intentionally
5. 0.828581 I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells

Similar to review 4 - Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out :
1. 0.7232 Back in the box and the return process started within 15 min of receiving it
2. 0.695406 Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to
3. 0.686579 Ratchet unit slips when you put a load on it
4. 0.682927 I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon
5. 0.676253 I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks

Similar to review 5 - Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place :
1. 0.750618 I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off
2. 0.739521 Easy to install, has worked well so far
3. 0.732503 With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly
4. 0.724679 Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use
5. 0.720662 It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely
