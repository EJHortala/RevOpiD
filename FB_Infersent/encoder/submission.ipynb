      "I too must agree with this well deserved honor\n",
      "Well, why do I find this game fantastic? Well, I'll explain that in my review\n",
      "First off let's talk about Banjo Kazooie's story\n",
      "Banjo's sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda\n",
      "Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tooty's beauty to her, but not if Banjo\n",
      "his friend Kazooie can help it! Okay, seriously this story is pretty lame, but hey! It's a game\n",
      "In My opinion, no matter how good the graphics are,\n",
      "how great the story is, it all boils down to one thing\n",
      "And that's gameplay\n",
      "And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay\n",
      "In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo and\n",
      "well\n",
      "Kazooie,\n",
      "Kazooie stays inside Banjo's backpack at all times, but she's not useless\n",
      "They both work as a team\n",
      "learn many moves, which brings us to our next character, Bottles\n",
      "Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda\n",
      "rescue Tooty\n",
      "But do you just walk up to Gruntilda\n",
      "save Tooty? Not at all, there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda\n",
      "The most important one is jiggies, there are ten jiggies in each world\n",
      "you need several items to collect them\n",
      "Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items, such as eggs to shoot through Kazooie's mouth,\n",
      "how to fly when you collect enough feathers\n",
      "Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens\n",
      "Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair\n",
      "if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo\n",
      "he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey\n",
      "So you have plenty to do in this game, I can guarantee that\n",
      "Another essential item are music notes, in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around\n",
      "if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntilda's massive lair\n",
      "But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes\n",
      "Why? You may ask\n",
      "Because each time you leave\n",
      "re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected\n",
      "Let's say you've collected ninety-nine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect, well if you leave the world\n",
      "re-enter, you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again, you couldn't go searching for the one music note you hadn't collected\n",
      "And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect\n",
      "Fortunately, if you don't care about collecting all one hundred music notes, you don't have to because the game automatically saves the amount you've collected\n",
      "There aren't too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie,\n",
      "it didn't take me long to master them\n",
      "And there aren't many control problems, actually the controls are almost perfect\n",
      "But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game, I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges, there was many times in Clanker's Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge,  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldn't hang on to the ledge\n",
      "While yet this wasn't too big of a deal, I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating\n",
      "I was also very pleased with camera control, there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas\n",
      "I found it easy to maneuver\n",
      "I told you this game was made in 1998, right? Well the graphics are terrific\n",
      "The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable\n",
      "You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove,\n",
      "wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion\n",
      "And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant, it's a forest\n",
      "you collect jiggies in the four season's spring, summer, fall\n",
      "winter\n",
      "I especially loved Freezeezy Peak,\n",
      "it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman\n",
      "I also loved the music in this game, each beat is catchy\n",
      "it never got repetitive for me,\n",
      "the sound effects were great as well\n",
      "well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny\n",
      "I loved the insults between Kazooie\n",
      "Bottles\n",
      "Gruntilda's rhymes cracked me up, that's another reason I love this game, it has such a charm to it, not like some newer games, to many games have steered away from being innocent\n",
      "charming,\n",
      "this game has this quality\n",
      "What more can I say? This game is fun to play, it has great replay value, the music, sounds\n",
      "the worlds all sound\n",
      "look absolutely fantastic\n",
      "the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well\n",
      "It took me thirty hours to complete (without a guide)\n",
      "I had so much fun solving puzzles\n",
      "this game can test your mind at certain times\n",
      "I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies, but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile, very satisfying if you ask me\n",
      "I'm now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie, as it's been claimed to be even better than the original\n",
      "Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended, this game is indeed a classic\n",
      "The game is just awesome\n",
      "Although the game can be quite challenging, the game is still fun to play! The music, sound effects,\n",
      "the graphics are just awesome\n",
      "I think Grant Kirkhope did a good job on the music\n",
      "Anyways, here's the plot:The story starts off in Spiral Mountain, where lives a heroic brown honey bear named Banjo, a red,\n",
      "loud-mouthed bird called Kazooie, Banjo's bird partner,\n",

      "That's not too difficult, as I'd say about 97 of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake\n",
      "More than 880 of the 900 music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty (you just can't count on Rare to make a strictly children's game: see Diddy Kong Racing)\n",

      "Longevity--5/10A game should only be as long as it needs to be, but I think Banjo-Kazooie needed to be a little longer\n",
      "Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario 64, it's no excuse that Rare couldn't match that level of magnitude\n",
      "But it's unfair to compare any game to Super Mario 64\n",

      "After finishing it, there's no reason to go back\n",

      "his grumpy bird friend Kazooie (who for some reason lives in Banjo's backpack) set out to Gruntilda's lair to save Tooty\n",
      "The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth\n",
      "The game doesn't move from place to place at all; the whole thing takes place in Gruntilda's huge lair, key word being 'huge\n",
      "' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game\n",
      "There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair, with a sewer, swamp, graveyard,\n",
      "many other spots\n",
      "The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the game's nine worlds, which are all big, diverse,\n",

      "later a snow area\n",
      "haunted mansion-like world,\n",
      "so on\n",
      "The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you, which is really nice, even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre, too\n",
      "Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn\n",
      "In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him\n",
      "These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on,\n",
      "they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically\n",
      "You have to unlock some of these abilities, such as flight\n",
      "invincibility, to get deeper into Gruntilda's lair,\n",
      "also to accomplish more in the worlds\n",
      "The game controls very well too, even with all the added moves,\n",
      "it doesn't get too complicated\n",
      "One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room\n",
      "area\n",
      "But the core of the game stays the same, no matter how many moves you learn\n",
      "different worlds you visit\n",
      "The main objects to collect are jiggies, which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that, when put together, open the door to a new world\n",
      "Ten of these can be found in each level along with 100 notes, which open up doors to new areas of the lair\n",
      "Unfortunately the game's note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level; each time you re-enter a world the note count restarts\n",
      "This is pretty annoying sometimes,\n",
      "it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you don't have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count\n",
      "Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds\n",
      "Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough\n",
      "The visuals are just a tad choppy, but they still look good enough,\n",
      "that sort of thing happened all the time in the N64 era\n",
      "Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed\n",
      "Despite these few flaws, though, the graphics look great considering the times\n",
      "One of Banjo's shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound\n",
      "The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language (with text shown on the bottom of the screen)\n",
      "this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character\n",
      "The sound effects are all good too, no complaints there\n",
      "The really cool part of the sound, though, is the music\n",
      "The tracks are cool enough as they are, but when you're standing on a different spot or in a different area, like if you're under water or at the entrance to a different world, the music style\n",
      "sound totally changes while keeping the same song\n",
      "Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style,\n",

      "If you like games where you have to think\n",
      "games that are tedious, both are for you\n",
      "Overall, since Banjo-Kazooie makes you think quite a bit more\n",
      "has the extra puzzle-finding feature to it, I would suggest you pick up Banjo-Kazooie first\n",
      "then either get Banjo-Tooie if you truly enjoyed the first game, or get Super Mario 64 if you want to play a slightly different video game\n",
      "Also, Banjo-Kazooie is A LOT easier than Super Mario 64\n",
      "So when you go to the store to pick which of the two games to buy, remember that unless you have a lot of free time on you hands, you probably shouldn't buy Super Mario 64\n",
      "Not one of the best games\n",

      "I only play it for about two minutes\n",

      "grueling-but in a good way\n",

      "fun\n",
      "my favorite is the graveyard/haunted house level\n",
      "(i forgot it's name\n",
      ")buy it\n",
      "i command you\n",
      "i LOVE this game, the stuff is done so perfectly\n",
      "near flawless\n",
      "here is my review of the game so i'll sort the different aspects into sections\n",
      "PLOT: 8/10 the plot is relatively simple, you have to rescue your sister, who has been kidnapped by an evil witch who wants to steal her beauty\n",
      "kinda cliche, but pulled off very nicely, the witch Gruntilda constantly speaks in rhymes,\n",
      "the she sends you threats while you go through the hub (her lair),\n",
      "taunts you,\n",
      "even tries to trick you with false offers\n",
      "and as you go on she gets less\n",
      "less sure of herself, so the plot is really a \"between the lines\" sort of deal\n",
      "not to mention that there is even a \"game over\" video, rather than a screen, so you see what happens when you fail\n",
      "GRAPHICS: 10/10 while they may not be so great anymore, these graphics were really the best you could find back then\n",
      "they were even better than the PS1 games, which were really something because the only other N64 games that came close to the PS1 games required the expansion pack, so you can tell they worked hard on the graphics because this one doesn't need the expansion\n",
      "SOUND: 10/10 along with sick graphics Banjo-Kazooie still has some of the best sounds in video game history\n",
      "i mean, the two main characters are named after instruments, right? the songs are all memorable\n",
      "each one has a certain feeling too\n",
      "Spiral mountain has a lot of happy memories, while Mad Monster Mansion could fill your mind with fear\n",
      "sadness\n",
      "also, the effects have great sounds too, when you find a 1-up, when you kill a monster, when a monster hits you,\n",
      "etc\n",
      "GAMEPLAY: 9\n",
      "99/10 what is a game without good gameplay, a bad one, that's what\n",
      "luckily, Banjo-Kazooie has some of the best gameplay you'll ever find in a platformer game\n",
      "you can run, punch, roll,\n",
      "even fly, there's even more things than Super Mario 64, or even Galaxy for that matter\n",
      "also, as the game goes on you learn new moves, get more upgrades,\n",
      "you can even transform into other animals with help from the shaman Mumbo Jumbo\n",
      "you'll learn a move called the \"talon trot\" which helps you move much faster while you're in a hurry,\n",
      "even before you learn that you can always roll, then when you're about to stop, jump\n",
      "it's almost as fast\n",
      "really easy to do\n",
      "the only thing that kept me from giving it a 10, was the swimming\n",
      "you can hold A to swim slowly,\n",
      "B to let Kazooie use her wings to make you speed off\n",
      "the problem though is that holding A makes you go extremely slowly,\n",
      "holding B comes in short bursts of speed\n",
      "not only that but letting go of B is like sliding on ice, it's extremely hard to aim where you want to go\n",
      "once you let go of the button, you start slowly stopping,\n",
      "this can be very annoying in Clanker's cavern, where you'll spend a lot of time in 70 feet deep sewage water, because that is probably the worst place to drown\n",
      "OVERALL: 10/10 overall, this game purely deserves the 10/10\n",
      "if they make a new Banjo-Kazooie game that somehow comes out on a nintendo console, with just as good factors,\n",
      "they have better swimming, i'll call it the best game ever\n",
      "I really like this game very much!!! It is by far better than the PSX game Rascal which really sucks\n",
      "I have never played the sequel but I think it is really good\n",
      "This game has great graphics\n",
      "It is one of the best platformers ever\n",
      "Every N64 owner should own this great game!!!!\n",
      "Recommend this to all to play\n",
      "Really like this game\n",
      "Would recommend this to all to get\n",
      "Great item\n",
      "Better than it's sequel, which was a little more confusing\n",
      "This is on the top ten list of Nintendo games, hands down\n",
      "If the music was released on soundtrack, I'd buy it in a heartbeat, especially for &quot;Click Clock Wood&quot;\n",
      "&quot;Enter Furnace Fun, (Right At The Pad)&quot;  The music is just hands down, 2nd best to Quest 64\n",
      "The graphics are very nice\n",
      "Nothing violent, but nothing incredibly mild\n",
      "Well done\n",
      "Gameplay\n",
      "Plot-Gameplay, it's VERY easy to control\n",
      "And the plot is very good-Saving your younger sister fromm looking like an ugly witch! VERY original!I got this two years ago\n",
      "I'm not tired yet, does that say something? Use the Gameshark for this, too!!! It does mess up your moves at Mad Monster Mansion if you have an older version though\n",
      "This game is just as I remembered it from my childhood\n",
      "Hours of entertainment,\n",
      "dang, it can sure be difficult at times!\n"

      "49. If you like SuperMario64, then there's a good chance you'll will like this game\n",
      "50. There is some cool stuff in the game, like being able to fly by collecting feathers in connection with using a jump pad thingy\n",
      "51. This is a good game if you like to spend a lot of time wandering around through worlds\n",
      "52. The game still offers a lot of gameplay, but is a little bit of a \"card-board cut-out\" type of play\n",

      "58. This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole\n",
      "59. I'd recommend the sequel, Banjo Tooie, instead as its 10 times more entertaining\n",
      "60. The product was in great condition, even better than I expected for 'Acceptable'\n",
      "61. It even included a quick guide for cleaning methods of the game, should it be unplayable\n",

      "25. But when a revolution comes, what's the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on? In video games, a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model\n",
      "26. The story doesn't take itself very seriously at all but there's a great, humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth\n",
      "27. ' This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game\n",

      "29. Thankfully the jiggies are extremely well-balanced as far as how hard they are to get; in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs, but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds\n",
      "30. It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the game-making world, but Banjo-Kazooie is a real gem from Rare's glory days on the N64,\n",
      "31. Banjo Kazooie has an entertaining story line which helps to create excitement in every level of the game, You start off on spiral mountain where the sleepy bear naps through his little sisters kidnapping, When he awakes Kazooie is on the floor\n",
      "32. I canot think of much to write for this game other than if you havent played it go buy it, It is worth the money\n",

      "34. But you can in this game :) I loved the first starting point level where you can just hang out as Banjo\n",
      "35. I LOVED how one of the last levels is a game show where they quiz you on every little detail about the game :) one thing I hate about modern state of the art games is how it takes maybe two days to defeat the whole game\n",
      "36. I can't even get started on all the levels, I could write a novel about how amazing all the levels are\n",
      "37. There were so many games that I loved in 64 that I would love to see all over again\n",
      "38. But although the core gameplay between the two is undeniably similar, the whole feels different enough to still feel entertaining\n",
      "39. Where as Mario 64 has you hunting down caps that grant you certain powers, Banjo seeks transformations (which is one of the game's most entertaining aspects) that sometimes change how you play completely\n",

      "41. The levels all relatively easy, however it is very easy to die in this game, on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying\n",
      "42. unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rare's part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game\n",
      "43. Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces (100 hidden through out the entire game), musical notes (100 on each level), little Jinjo people (5 on each level), there are also Mumbo skulls to find, they allow you (once you have the required amount) to change form, you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often\n",
      "44. Now I was never an expret at video games but I wanted to do a little better than that! SO I went\n",
      "45. But how fun are they? Well, they're all very fun to play in, mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood, from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music, this game has that\n",
      "46. If you read my previous review of the game Banjo-Tooie, you'd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much\n",
      "47. This game has been my all time favorite since I can remember! It is right up there with Mario!!! You must try this game out!\n",
      "48. The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to; you  have many things to collect\n",
      "49. the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed, depending on your situation\n",
      "50. This game is solid for 50+ hours of gaming, but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece\n",
      "51. I was worried ordering a used game because some I'd ordered from places in the past haven't worked, but have absolutely no complaints!For any who want a review of the game itself:Of all the games we played growing up this one stood out due to its creativity\n",
      "52. bought the soundtrack so she could listen on her own!Hats off to the makers of this game, because the level of creativity\n",
      "53. they were even better than the PS1 games, which were really something because the only other N64 games that came close to the PS1 games required the expansion pack, so you can tell they worked hard on the graphics because this one doesn't need the expansion\n",
      "54. SOUND: 10/10 along with sick graphics Banjo-Kazooie still has some of the best sounds in video game history\n",
      "55. also, the effects have great sounds too, when you find a 1-up, when you kill a monster, when a monster hits you,\n",
      "56. I really like this game very much!!! It is by far better than the PSX game Rascal which really sucks\n",
      "57. I'm not tired yet, does that say something? Use the Gameshark for this, too!!! It does mess up your moves at Mad Monster Mansion if you have an older version though\n",

      "2. Compared to Super Mario 64, I can't help but say, is that all?There are a total of nine worlds, as well as a main hub world, which is too labyrinthine for its purpose\n",
      "3. more recently, I played the GBA Banjo Kazooie to death!This game, while great in many ways, doesn't hold up too well today, especially if you play it AFTER playing later Rareware games\n",

      "6. just better than 90% of the stuff the N64 was pumping out at the time\n",
      "7. But seriously, why am I basically doing nothing but walking around collecting items the entire time?  If you think \"That's what ALL platformers do!\" guess again: many of them focus on exciting enemy variety, diverse surroundings\n",
      "8. The only challenge is to avoid falling from high narrow platforms while collecting musical notes- these are dirty tricks\n",
      "9. weird gigantic green enemies that come out of walls while you're trying to make your way across high paths without falling\n",

      "11. insects which is somewhat satisfying for the sake of seeing the occasional brief moments of diversity, but otherwise nothing to get really excited about\n",
      "12. the game is a victim of underwater tragedies- you're constantly adjusting the camera for a more appropriate angle but finding that it's much harder than it needs to be\n",
      "13. Kazooie the bird is probably the only tolerable one of the bunch\n",
      "14. everything is great except for one thing- you get a small quantity of food so you ask yourself \"Is it worth my time to return here again?\"\n",

      "4. re-enter a world all the notes are still there, no matter how many you've collected\n",
      "5. And while yet this situation is highly unlikely, it's still annoying no matter how many notes you have to re-collect\n",
      "6. well the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game, but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny\n",
      "7. If you really think you can make it through this place, the stage is still challenging of all\n",
      "8. Works great, never had any problems with just sometimes I need to blow on the cartridge\n",
      "9. I'm not going to fill this review with stories\n",
      "10. even though they never talk, they make one sound, but it's repeated to represent their conversations, obviously\n",
      "11. It's not like one sound repeated at the same note, you can easily tell that the sounds may be a bit deeper\n",
      "12. just from that, you've probably wasted too much time to get through the rest of the rings\n",
      "13. I haven't even succeeded in this move, but I may be able to pull it off soon\n",
      "14. you don't have to follow the worlds in any certain order, which is really cool\n",
      "15. You don't feel, I guess you could say, ''restrained'' because you must go to one certain world before another every time\n",
      "16. I'm not a Nintendo fanboy, so don't even go there\n",
      "17. One issue though is with the camera, which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes can't get the viewpoint that's just right for a room\n",
      "18. Sometimes objects that are a little ways away won't appear on screen until you get closer, which thankfully doesn't prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed\n",
      "19. this might annoy some but it's still good to add personality to each character\n",
      "20. this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say it's really, really cool\n",
      "21. I have searched 5 stores, none have had it\n",
      "22. yes it is but its out of stock, it asked if I would write a review\n",
      "23. I thought, why not\n",
      "24. I can see now why it was all the rage when we were kids!\n",
      "25. But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that, occasionally, it works really well\n",
      "26. because nobody plays Nintendo 64 anymore\n",
      "27. I would like to play it all over again\n",
      "28. I've never really had enough of an attention span to play \"collect the item\" games, but this particular one is really great\n",

      "33. I have NEVER played anything like it again\n",
      "34. there is nothing that i can think of that is wrong with it\n",
      "35. If you have seen a Rare game, you know that they  have good graphics, so no exception here, very well done\n",
      "36. It is by no means for everybody\n",
      "37. There is not a dull moment in this game,\n",
      "38. There isn't really an advancing story, but that's okay\n",
      "39. i try not to think about it\n",
      "40. not to mention that there is even a \"game over\" video, rather than a screen, so you see what happens when you fail\n",
      "41. not only that but letting go of B is like sliding on ice, it's extremely hard to aim where you want to go\n",
