2: The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs
3: The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps
4: It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider

7: This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks

5: It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much
6: My advice is to just be careful or wear gloves while adjusting it
7: My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling

9: If your moving anything heavy don't count on this bar
10: Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out
11: If you are looking for a heavy duty piece of equipment
12: I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure
13: You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving
14: Lots of bumps and jumps and still works like a champ
15: I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!
16: If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two)
17: So please get familiar with it before you need it
18: So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

3: Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home

Cluster 11:
1: I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon
2: I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks
3: Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it
4: If you are like me, I just through items in the back of my truck and hope they are still there wherever I'm going
5: But with this Ratchet Cargo Bar, I can still through things, but I can now through them in the right place
6: Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world
7: After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it

Cluster 12:
1: Fits in any location and allows you to store equipment securely
2: The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust
3: This thing was a steal for $25 and free shipping
4: It is of high quality and held my cargo in the bed of my truck from Colorado to Southern California
5: A bit of screwing around and you'll master it
6: Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby
7: The product is cheaply made and would not stay locked in place on the desired adjustment
8: I don't know how good this product will be on holding back heavy items, but it works well on garden flowers they all stead in place with this bar
9: the shipping time was less than expected
10: This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years
11: Defective ratchet
12: You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars
13: I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed
14: I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star
15: I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O
16: The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position
17: In my opinion a good value as well
18: i tok this item to my SUV, its defict the plastic internal
19: Great item , best one I have ever used
20: I just love shopping at Amazon,because they have so many great merchants
21: It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home
22: Open your box ASAP
23: The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable
24: This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
25: Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady
26: Performs exactly as expected
27: This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product
28: If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set
29: When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced
30: Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet
31: Ends were open
32: BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight and simple this may be a good choice
33: Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy
34: You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk
35: Just received it for Christmas
36: It provides a sturdy anchor for my cargo bed contents and will hold a mower right where you want it
37: Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC and back
38: That leaves me without a tailgate
39: Could only achieve tension to hold bar in place in certain spots
40: Lets hope this second one lives up to it's potential
41: Keeps it from sliding around and breaking my fishing rods :-)
42: After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did
43: (No staying-put power)I will try the twist type system next
44: New Hampshire
45: Excellent deal!!  Would buy more if needed more

Cluster 13:
1: You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click
2: Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly
3: When it is tightened it just pops off the gear and will not create enough tension to hold in place
4: Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on and it took forever to get right and didn't seem to hold as well
5: will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can and it still will not hole very good
6: The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly
7: Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point
8: Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to
9: Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening
10: just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release
11: Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first

Cluster 14:
1: Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr
2: It's one of those you get what you pay for
3: a good value for the cost
4: Would buy again!
5: The price is right too
6: This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost
7: I'd buy it again
8: Outstanding price
9: definitely worth the price

Cluster 15:
1: Might break a weld on the inside of your bed
2: I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered
3: Guess where it ends up when you try to use it? In the middle of the bed
4: I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper
5: Ratchet unit slips when you put a load on it
6: I have a screw type one and it is a pain
7: My Ranger has one of those useless and unattractive narrow beds

Cluster 16:
1: I received the order promptly but the ratcheting device did not function as well as I had expected
2: The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked
3: So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds
4: My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy
5: The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place
6: The locking mechanism simply would not hold

Cluster 17:
1: Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews
2: If I had to think of a weakness
3: only had the for short time but I do like them
4: I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me
5: Perfect for my needs -- I was a little concerned by the "pinching" reviews, but I had no problems in that regards
6: I have had no problems with it
7: ) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it
8: Have had no problems at all
9: It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this
10: I haven't had any problems with it, but it's a little difficult to get it to release some times

Cluster 18:
1: I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it
2: I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time
3: I would recommend trying a different cargo bar
4: I do not recommend this cargo bar
5: If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it
6: Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one
7: I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar
8: I would recommend you keep looking for a sturdier cargo bar
9: This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place

Cluster 19:
1: I bought a more expensive one and returned it
2: His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle)
3: This was more sturdy and fit my needs better
4: I was expecting something more sturdy
5: I was disappointed in the bar diameter and overall durability
6: I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight
7: So it's sturdy enough to take a beating

Cluster 20:
1: Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place
2: I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks
3: With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly
4: I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off
5: Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move

Cluster 21:
1: This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds
2: This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed
3: Holds things very securely in the bed of the truck
4: 5' F150 truck bed perfectly
5: It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner
6: Worked well in my truck bed with bedliner and camper shell

Cluster 22:
1: This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected
2: The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew)
3: It's worth the money paid and I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed
4: This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use
5: I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine
6: So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler
7: I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point
8: This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks)
9: Been a great cargo bar, I use it for holding plastic bins in place in the bed of my truck and so far it has worked great and has never budged unless I have removed it intentionally
10: Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything
11: I bought this cargo bar in a hurry to keep our coolers and gas cans in place during our 800 mile death valley off road adventure

Cluster 23:
1: I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed
2: I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate
3: I have a bed cover on and it makes it easier to carry stuff from the store without having the stuff slide forward
4: easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it
5: This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall
6: It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed
7: as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate
8: This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed
9: Spreads and retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner
10: I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup

Cluster 24:
1: Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out
2: I purchase this item several weeks ago and it works as advertised
3: Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use
4: I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out
5: I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his
6: It did slip once while I was adjusting last click
7: I have already pinched my fingers in it several times and have only owned it for about 3 weeks
8: It is to late to get a replacement
9: I didn't open the box until I needed them
10: I should've had one these years ago
11: Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak
12: Back in the box and the return process started within 15 min of receiving it
13: I had to return one already because it broke
14: Just as I expected it held in place the entire trip and it got abused
15: It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly

Cluster 25:
1: Tightened down a bit and it was secure
2: It's useless now
3: One high, one low
4: It,however,is a low cost,durable multi use product
5: It's a bit tricky to get used too
6: One is broken
7: It was okay, but cumbersome
8: This product is trash
9: A little on the flimsy side
10: A bit weak but the price is cheap
11: This item was horrible

Cluster 26:
1: Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in
2: When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep
3: After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place
4: Cargo bar will not tighten tight enough to hold its self up let alone holding cargo
5: This bar is pretty flimsy and difficult to release it will not hold anything stable that has any weight to it
6: These cargo bars fit it perfectly - no complaints with the quality or operation after a winter of holding cargo
7: Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps
8: This is  the first ratcheting cargo bar that I have had and I recomend it highly very easy to adjust and the ratchet action makes it very easy to use

Cluster 27:
1: I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money
2: No regrets from me on this purchase
3: Will not hold in place
4: It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile
5: Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy
6: It has not failed me yet
7: The device is not worth it

Cluster 28:
1: My husband asked for a similar item as a gift but I wanted to see reviews so I shopped Amazon
2: Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada
3: Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one
4: We returned the item and paid more for a better made product he found in a store
5: I bought this, and it will not stay where I put it, and Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!
6: Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED
7: I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach
8: Missing a screw at one end now I have to go to store and find one to fit! Packing should have been better
9: Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about
10: After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one

Cluster 29:
1: I would buy this again
2: I would absolutely purchase again
3: I would recommend them to a friend
4: I would be on the fence to recommend this product
5: would recommend it to friends  it is  great
6: I might be able to find something it will work with
7: I would highly recommend this to anybody

Cluster 30:
1: It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards
2: It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity
3: Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis
4: No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product
5: It may function to restrain small light items but not much more
6: For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded
7: Never had a problem with it slipping or not unlocking or anything
8: It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it

Cluster 31:
1: Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly
2: The ratchet part works great
3: This thing is heavy duty and works excellent
4: Also the finish seems to be good quality
5: A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality
6: The ratchet part is very well made
7: The quality is there,  and the ratchet works very well
8: It is made of good quality material and workmanship
9: Fit great into my S10 and secures very well using the ratchet mechanism
10: However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate

Cluster 32:
1: if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar
2: When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance
3: The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center
4: I wanted a strong ratchet type bar and this is exactly it
5: The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds
6: The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other
7: When I went to tighten then ratchet down to lock, the bar would buckle a bit and jump a detent on the ratchet bar

Cluster 33:
1: This one had one of the best reviews and so far it doing the job
2: Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering
3: Seems to be built very well too
4: It has worked well since being put in place
5: I have been using it and it works very well
6: I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product
7: Easy to install, has worked well so far
8: for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do
9: I have been using this for almost a year now and it works great
10: I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works
11: I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded and difficult to extend constently
12: What can I say just a perfect design works excellent

Cluster 34:
1: Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks
2: When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space
3: I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed
4: the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck
5: I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason

Cluster 35:
1: it is still in place and working
2: Stays in place very well
3: Great product, works real well
4: The one works ok
5: This is much better
6: This is great
7: This one works great every time
8: Other than that, it works perfectly

Cluster 36:

2: The cargo bar is great
3: The bar feels solid
4: I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar
5: Super value
6: Nice cargo bar for the price
7: Great Product and seller
8: Keeper 05059 Ratcheting Cargo BarSorry  Will S

Cluster 37:
1: The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened
2: The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place
3: I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells
4: At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls
5: I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension
6: I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar
7: The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer) and consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls

Cluster 38:
1: Doesn't get excessively tight in my truck (thus the 4 stars)
2: After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext
3: Keeps my load in place
4: It fits my 6
5: Once secured in place it stays there
6: Just crank down on it
7: Easy to use, stays locked tight
8: My cargo held tight

Cluster 39:
1: My husband ordered this to keep his ice chest from sliding in the back of his work truck (full-size Chevrolet)
2: The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless
3: When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck
4: I am just about 6 feet tall and I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck
5: You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed
6: Perfect for keeping stuff from sliding around the bed of a truck during normal driving
7: Great for keeping the ice chest at the back of the truck
