{'reviewerID': 'A3GT2EWQSO45ZG', 'asin': 'B00002243X', 'reviewerName': 'DeusEx', 'helpful': [19, 19], 'reviewText': 'I absolutley love Amazon!!!  For the price of a set of cheap Booster/Jumper Cables in a brick and morter store, you can buy extra long and heavy duty jumpers!  First off, don\'t be the person that not only needs to ask a kind passer-by for a "jump" but also if they have jumper cables.  It\'s MUCH easier to get a jump start if you have your own cables.Next lets talk about sizing.  Having the longest cable possible is a major plus if your car is parked up against something like a pole or wall, or even parked on a one way street.  The "booster car" (the car w/o a dead battery) can pull in close enough to use the cables without having to manuver into some akward position.  Or better yet, you won\'t have to push your vehicle into a position to be jumped.  If your diving a normal sized car they can even pull in behind you to jump you!  Or if their vehicle is the shorter of the two, they could pull in front.  Now how about gauge?  For those who aren\'t electricians or engineers, as the number value of gauge decreases, the size and capacity of the cable increases.  So for example 6-ga has about twice as much copper wire as 8-ga, and 4-ga is a about twice as much as 6-ga, so on and so on.  That doesn\'t mean you double the capacity of wire with every two numbers though.  4-gauge may sound like a lot but it really isn\'t.The technical stuff.  Don\'t worry if this doesn\'t make sense, you don\'t really need to know all of this, but I\'m trying to make a point as to why to get the longest and heavist cables you can.  I\'m not an electrican but I\'ve worked with it long enough to know a few general rules of thumb.  First of the enemy of electricty is resistance.  Resistance ultimately determines the load a particular wire can carry.  Five things factor into resistance.  Temperature, conductor, voltage, load, and distance.  Temp we can\'t control, so we have to assume the worst (HOT)...or in other words need heavier cable.  Conductor should be copper, or at least a high purity mix of copper...good there.  Voltage...12VDC is a low voltage system...probably the biggest problem we face.  Since is a low voltage system we have to contend with voltage drop as it travels over the wire.  The higher the voltage, the longer it can run with acceptable levels of voltage drop over a particular gauge wire...so again since it\'s low voltage need heavier gauge wire.  Load (Amperage)...it\'s a car starter so it takes A LOT of power.  The voltage is a fixed number (more or less) so Amperage is determined by the size of the engine your trying to start.  And you\'d be surprised how high that can be.  Even a small engine can be well over 300 Cranking Amps.  That said even a "dead" battery will put out some power.  As for distance...this cables selling point is also a draw back.  25\' is LONG run for 12VDC.  So like I said in the last line 4-ga isn\'t as much as you think.  In fact, if you have an engine over 6-liters you should really consider 2-ga for this distance.  So summing up in layman\'s terms...considering the hot temperatures outside, the fact that it\'s 12VDC and we need a long cable, and that we\'re trying to start a car engine (which takes a LOT of power) these are the ONLY cables I could reccomend for anyone driving a small car up to a light truck.Lets talk about how to properly start a car with a drained battery.  Make sure the LAST connection make is the NEG clamp to the "dead" car on a frame ground (something metal and NOT MOVING or GOING TO MOVE in the engine compartment.)  Don\'t attach it directly to the battery\'s NEG post.  Next lightly rev the engine of the running vehicle for 3 to 5 minutes.  This will put a bit of a surface charge on the dead battery.  Then attempt to start the car.  As soon as it starts remove the cables (starting with the NEG on the car being jumped.)  If you ever have a dead battery for any reason...take it to an auto parts store as soon as possible and have it tested to make sure it still holds a proper charge.  Most places do it for free.  NEVER touch the clamps together once connected to a battery!!!  Doing so could damage you vehicles electrical system, and/or cause fire, burns, explosion of the battery, damages to your cables...A couple of final thoughts.  Protect your investment.  I bought a cable bag that works really well to keep them from getting tangled with everything in my trunk.  Also keep the twist ties that come with them which will keep them organized inside the cable bag.  And once used, take them home and clean and dry them before storing them once again.

After much research, my understanding is that the higher the am-page rating, the better chance you will start your car in cold weather, usually a new car battery has 350-400A Cold Crank Ampage (CCA). Since these cables are made of Copper Clad Aluminum (also abbreviated as CCA coincidentally), their ampacity are only equivalent to 1 gauge lower diameter pure copper wire ( search 'Ampacity of Copper & Aluminum Wire, it's published in the NEC code). What's more with longer cable the resistance also goes up so you will loss some ampacity along the way. My experience with Coleman's 8 Guage 12' cable is that unless I attach to the dead battery's negative post, it won't deliver enough juice to start the car by connecting to the engine block ground point to my Honda Civic (mid size car use 400A CCA battery), so my assumption is anything has current rating less than 200A can't be used without acting against the label warning by connecting to the dead battery's negative post.

Coleman seems to be a well respected company. After inspecting the 08660 twenty foot long four gauge cables, I am satisfied with my purchase.

There is a top of page review dated September 14th 2006 by Privacy Advocate titled "Slight disappointment" in which he describes his concern about the clamps having only one side of the jaw plated with copper. This actually is an intelligent design. The copper cable is connected to only one jaw (the jaw that is copper plated for increased conductivity). Copper plating the non-connected jaw would be counter productive. I recommend purchasing a minimum length of twenty feet, a minimum of four gauge cable, and clamps rated a minimum of 500 amps. The length is recommended because you may not always be able to place a boost vehicle nose to nose or side by side. The gauge and amps are particularly important if you live in a cold climate.

The clips are decent and will work on most if not all battery set-ups you come across; they grab tightly but are not too hard for the average person to squeeze open.The wire is crimped to the jaws and but the instalated part of the wire is not also crimped. There is a place on the jaws to crimped the insulated portion (which would then act as a stress relief) but it is not used. You can crimp it with a pair of pliers when you get the cables -- just tight enough to grab the cable is all you need -- this will prevent the cables form breaking away where the aluminum is crimpt to the metal.Jaw markings-- there are three types of markings boasted by the maker: First is Color -- Indeed one can easily identify one side of the paired cable form the other by the color of the jaws.Second - Indent stamping -- the polarity is stamped into the metal jaws -- The imprint is not disticnt and not very easy to read in good light. At night, it would be useless and one couldn\'t read the impression by feel. So these are practically useless.Third -- Phosphorescent labeling -- phosphorescence stores up energy for a short while after strong light exposure and slowly sheds the energy as dim light. So, if you put the cables in the sun for a while, the labels will glow for few minutes. This would help you if you need to jump your battery at night only if you have some sunlight to hold the cables under for a while. Most people will keep the cables in their trunk anyway, where it is genrally dark, so the cables won\'t have been recently exposed to a lot of sunlight. I suppose one could hold them in front of the car headlights for a few minutes and then moved away from the headlights and quickly read the labels, that would work. But then, why not just read the color of the clips while holding them in front of the headlights? The phosfluoresecnt labels are just a silly useless sales come-on.They are not, but even if the labels were made with tritium capsules -tritium is a radiant ionic form of Hydrogen (used sometimes on wristwatches -- the tritium is spent after a few years. The notion of glowing labels on booster cables borders on idiotic.If you have trouble remembering which color to use for positive or negative, just remember that it doesn\'t matter! What matters is that the same color going to positive on one battery goes to positive on the other. You could use black for positive if you want or red.You always double the consistency of polarity before attaching the fourth clip. Even if they glow in the dark, have marquee lights blinking messages or they sing "I\'m positvely in love with you".These cables are for consumer (i.e., ocassional) use. For daily, professional use, you\'ll want real copper cables because copper doesn\'t corrode or fatigue as easily as aluminum. That\'s not an issue for cables receiving ocassional use. With ocassional use these will serve most motorists for a lifetime and serve well for the money even overlooking the silliness about the clip labels.', 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Good at the price but some flaws', 'unixReviewTime': 1382054400, 'reviewTime': '10 18, 2013'}

I do recommend buying 6-gauge or heavier cables, as these are, especially if they are copper-plated aluminum wire, as these appear to be. Aluminum has a higher resistance than copper, so the same gauge cable will conduct less current. 6-gauge should be sufficient for small and medium cars, where the starting current is not tremendously high - it may not be sufficient for large trucks or tractors, especially in cold weather.

Good length, good ga. wire and copper connectors. But for me where they fall short is at the clamps and this type of clamp seems to be on MANY cables available today. I could not see it in the photos but the clamps are uneven at the ends because of the extra notch the manufacturer adds on one side to make it easier to connect to side terminal batteries. Also there are NO teeth on the end of the jaws so you HAVE to make your connection using the teeth on the sides of the jaws.  This does not sound like a big deal until you are in a tight situation and have to clamp onto a top post battery straight down, then you have an uneven clamp end and no teeth to grip the post.  I happen to also have a car (a domestic) with a remote mounted battery, not a HOT ROD or modified car, just a stock factory production car where the manufacturer could not fit the battery under the hood for space saving and design reasons and put it elsewhere in the car.  Remote batteries used to be a rare thing on mostly European cars but it is fairly common now on all makes of cars.  With the battery not under the hood or in the trunk I have a Pos. and Neg. lug under the hood at the end of battery cables to jump the car with.  The Pos. lug is surrounded by plastic in a depression to prevent anything from accidentally hitting it and shorting.  Because of this there is little room and I can not get the side of these jumper cable clamps to grab the lug, I need teeth on the end of the jaws to grip the Pos. lug. I'm returning these cables and for $15 more (on sale) than the price of these cables I got the same length, the same 4 ga. wire, clamps with teeth on all 3 sides, even jaw ends, a side terminal connection in the jaws, and they came with a hard plastic storage case, safety glasses and gloves. After shopping around for a week I found this is a great deal.  I shopped all over the Net and in my local stores comparing prices wire length, size, and end clamps.

I am reviewing solely on inspecting them. With any luck, these will stay in the box behind the seat in my truck and I will never need to use them.A good set of jumper cables is a must in any vehicle, especially if you live in the frozen North (Cleveland here). Sure, you can buy some cheap 12 gauge or whatever at your local big box store. But I have personally been in situations where the cheap-o cables simply could not carry enough current to jump my vehicle. The cables were too thin to charge the battery in a reasonable amount of time, and could not carry enough juice to turn the starter.ALWAYS buy 2 or 4 gauge. ALWAYS buy long cables. I don't care what anyone says. Cars are low voltage but high amperage. A starter cranking needs a TON of juice. Those dainty little WM cables will not cut it. Enter these cables.At 4 gauge, these could probably jump a semi. At 20 feet, you can easily link two cars together even if one is in a difficult spot. When life happens, you do NOT want to be stuck somewhere with cables that aren't adequate.These cables fit the bill. The handles also appear to be fairly durable, which is important. I have had cheaper cables have the insulation on the handles flake off. Makes for a painful jump.Overall I am impressed with the workmanship and specifications for the price.
