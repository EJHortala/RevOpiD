Its tough out there, as there are many products that claim one of the above mentioned, but not both. After coming home from work and seeing my dog in an all day session of eating its own excrement I knew it was time to find a way to make him stop. I also knew that just like my dog, my kid is another important person in my life and if anything can be used for my dog, it should also be able to be used for my kid. Many of the competitive products out there are NOT all natural. Products like "Take the Poo out of your House", "Poo Free", "Ass Sealant" and "GG Allin\'s Stop Poo" claimed to work but were made of harsh chemicals that could damage my dogs liver, or my babies brain cells. Then it dawned on me, "Amazon sells stuff, I bet I could find something on there". After 7 days of learning how to read, I jumped on and started my search. I was able to find the Solid Gold S.E.P. and new this would tackle both necessities, Stop my dog from eating its own poo and be all natural just in case my kid would play with it.After a 2 week waiting period, I was too cheep to get the faster shipping (I\'ve been keeping my dog and kid outside for weeks now) I got the Solid Gold S.E.P. (Stop Eating Poop) and was ecstatic. If this product could do what it said it could, my life would be complete because the two people I love the most, my kid and my dog, could now live in harmony together with me in my trailer. After my dogs first dose, I could see a major difference. It was like my dog received Shock Therapy or something, cause every-time it motioned towards its anus, it would move away and almost start to yell kind of like that movie "A Clockwork Orange" when the main character was watching "ultra violence" and would get sick because of the treatments he was receiving. It was amazing, I really saw a difference. Next was to see what it would do to my kid, so I scooped a little bit out, according to the weight chart on the back of the item and fed it to my son. He may have not liked the taste, but if it could do to my kid what it does to my dog, I knew it would be worth the bad taste. It worked! My kid hasn\'t touched his own poo for weeks now. Its amazing.

Though we walk them in the morning and then check the side yard for any deposits before we leave for work, before using this product, it was not uncommon for us to come home to dogs with horrible breath and a side yard of half-eaten piles.  We also had a dog walker come 2-3 times a week in the middle of the day to walk them again (and pick up any piles) to alleviate this problem.  However, we still ecountered this problem rather frequently.  The poor dogs really suffered for it too because we didn't want them anywhere near us at night because they smelled so disgusting.With this product, we believe that the habit has stopped, if not all the way, at least to a significant degree.  Other than I think twice in the last six months, we now come home to dogs that don't gross us out with their bad breath anymore.  And everyone is much happier for it.One more thing:  Our first dog was starting to get finicky with his food.  I don't know if this powder was to blame or if it's a supplement that we also give to him.  But what I found out works really well are those liver biscotti sprinkles.

Foster and Smith called Distaste and it worked quite well, but my male dog wasn't terribly thrilled with it-- it came in chew form and he didn't seem to like them. So I found this SEP and was glad to see it's something mixed into their food. It does not work as well as the Distaste, but seems to discourage her. All winter I have noticed my female picking up frozen specimens and marching around the yard with them... but she doesn't seem to be eating them. I plan to double the dose, as some other reviewers have noted, and we'll see how things go through the spring. We are typically quick about cleaning up after them, particularly now that we can see the ground, but occasionally we miss a pile. I'm hoping that the problems we had this winter with the SEP not working well were maybe because the feces were frozen, and now that things are thawing, maybe the SEP will discourage her more strongly.So bottom line, it seems to be working fairly well, but has not broken the habit completely.
