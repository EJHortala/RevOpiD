Its a very unique booster seat, and we are VERY happy to have purchased one.It stays on our kitchen chairs easily (wooden chairs, with an upholstered bottom) and surprisingly enough the cooshie even grips onto those! It does grip better to our all wooden dining room chairs, but after reading the "melting" reviews, I will be using a kitchen chair for her while in the dining room :). It also adapts well to outdoor furniture, and just about ANY seating area. It doesn\'t have straps or anything that will eventually collect crud and just become annoying, and it "sticks" to the chairs due to cleverly thought out rubbery material, it grips to just about anything! The cooshie doesn\'t have buckles or anything to contain a child, so you should think twice before purchasing if your little munchkin just doesn\'t sit still, or may fall off. The cooshie is VERY lightweight and easy for my daughter to take off of her chair, and bring ANYWHERE she will be sitting, even directly on the floor! It has also been a fun pool toy (dont ask how the heck it got into the pool, because frankly I dont know!) and it floats, just its not to be used as a flotation device! The cooshie is SO EASY TO CLEAN, just wipe it up, and I swear you will never have to deep clean or anything, just wipe it up and EVERYTIME you are done!!My daughter LOVES sitting at the table with everyone, and the cooshie is actually very comfortable. She hasn\'t ruined hers yet, although she isn\'t a really rough girl, but it may become an issue with rambunctious children, as the foamy inside may rip or something, but if that ever DID happen, we would purchase another without any hesitation. She also has been able to get into the chair herself, which worried me, I though we would have to lift her. But the cooshie is just another obstacle that most kids will be able to get over, my daughter has developed a very "funny-to-watch" technique as to how she will get into her chair, so this shouldn\'t be a problem.I too found it annoying that my daughter cant lean back all the way, since there really isn\'t too much of a back, but enough to make it annoying to use the actual chair to lean back against (if that\'s hard to follow, I apologize, she just cant rest with the cooshie). It doesn\'t seem to bother her that much, but I wish there was SOMETHING that would enable her to "rest" back a bit. It will also destroy your wooden furniture if there\'s nothing between the cooshie and the wooden finish. The cooshie comes with a large carry bag, that we found very useful for eating out or going to relatives... it holds her cooshie, and bibs and whatnot for her younger brothers, or something to entertain her... it doesn\'t fold or anything, but I wouldnt expect any booster to be anymore "luggable" than the cooshie is.Its also great for the older crowd, my friends EIGHT year old was always sitting on his knees while eating, and he isn\'t really short, just that they have odd chairs, and that he preferred to be up closer. Once he tried the cooshie, he was more confident and comfortable, and actually wanted ours! So, this goes without saying, my friend purchased one for him and he takes his EVERYWHERE!The cooshie is just a great booster seat for older children, or at least toddlers.

However, my wife and I are yet to experience the miraculous calming effects at the dinner table that so many other reviews have mentioned.The Booster is made from one solid piece soft foam material.  The material is very lightweight and cleans up very easily.  The one-piece construction also aids in clean-up - no cracks to trap food or let spills get through to your furniture.  Plus, the material grips on wooden chairs;  it's never budged when our active two-year-old is using it.  This ease of use, both at the table and when getting washed in the sink, are its major selling points.On the other hand, the one-piece construction makes the bulky Booster less than ideal for use away from home.  Forget about using it at restaurants because it's not different enough from what they'll provide.  We only take ours out when we're going to Grandma and Grandpa's house for a few days;  otherwise, it's more trouble than it's worth.  Sure, it's lightweight, but the supplied carrying case is roughly the size of a bowling ball bag.  Plus, the bag is very cheap and unattractive;  basically they're selling you the packaging as a carrying case.Lastly, we haven't seen the Booster effect any great improvement in our son's attention span at the table - when he wants to get down, he wants to get down, period.  I don't believe that any booster seat could make such a difference in toddler behavior, so I don't hold it against this one;  I'm just surprised how many others have reported these results.  If anything, our son is frustrated by the Booster because its size prevents him from climbing into his chair unassisted.  Because he's in the toddler independence phase, he'd often rather climb into another chair by himself rather than be lifted into the Booster.So, the Booster does a great job of providing a simple-to-use and easy-to-maintain solution at home, but if you take your little one out frequently, a more portable options would suit you better.PROS*  Stable, soft foam stays in place without marking chairs*  Very easy to clean with one-piece constructionCONS*  Bulky on the go*  Will frustrate toddlers who like to climb into their own chair", 'overall': 3.0, 'summary': 'A Good Booster but Not the Perfect Solution', 'unixReviewTime': 1113177600, 'reviewTime': '04 11, 2005'}

It's great for travel and is easy to clean. Because there are no straps, it's great for taking out to eat instead of having them sit in the dirty booster seats in restaurants. However, BE VERY CAREFUL when your child is in this seat. It moves around fairly easily and a wiggly toddler can certainly pitch it off a chair without too much effort. It would be best used on a chair with arms or side rails, but on a kitchen chair or stool with only a back and no arms, you have to be at your child's side at all times. I have also found that it's very slippery on leather covered seats and better on solid wood (not secure, but less slippery). Very easy to clean and makes a nice outside seat on the ground for going to watch a game or have a picnic.

The cooshie was the best option, and certainly a wise choice.For us we wanted to have a booster that would be simple, no frills and amazing folding mechanisms, cool gadgets, and baby appealing features. We just wanted something to put on our chairs that could bring her up to the table. Well after looking at millions of hard boosters, with straps without, with trays without, reqlining, and folding, high backs, no backs, transformable, or one stage only... Finnally we laid eyes on the simplist one of them all, but definatly not the inferior model... The cooshie.It seemed so simple, like, "thats it", no straps to hold baby, no straps to hold to the chair, no trays, no back, no amazing features... but boy was this chair the winner of em\' all!I loved that my daughter could pick out her own "style", basically a color, but that seeming meaningless thing, was so important to her! She picked out the purple cooshie (I believe they come in blue, green, purple, and red). We were also able to bring it to one of those stands at a flea market, to get it customized with her name and the cool letters, now she was ready to be a big girl!Well now onto the actual chair... Its easy to set up, because you just have to place it on a chair! We have solid wood chairs, but we placed one of those non-slip mats on it, after hearing how it ruins the garnish and finish of the wooden chairs. It doesnt slip, flip, slide, or wiggle, no matter how much my daughter moves, it stays put. I wouldnt recomend you using it on ahpolstered chairs, unless its leather or something that a chair could "stick to". The chair has no back, no straps, no trays or anything... this means its for an OLDER TODDLER, just as a seat so they can reach the table. Its not for babies, and I doubt I would use it any earlier than 2 1/2 to 3 years old, its just not designed for babies. You dont purchase a two wheeler for your 18 month old and get dissapointed because your baby falls off adn gets injured do you... no, because a two wheeler bicycle is not designed for an 18 month old, its for an older child... Just like the cooshie. Its an excellent seat though. Its like a big block of foam, thats covered in a rubbery material so it sticks to your chair. Its extremely comfortable for a child, and my daughter INSISTS on using it on the floor, on the couch, at her tables, and anywhere else it could be useful, just because its hers, and because its a big girl seat... something that sets her apart from the babies. We dont mind her dragging it where ever she wants (have even found it with her in the bathtub! It actually floats and dries really well, thats durability for ya!). We also found it SUPER easy to clean. We just lift it up and wipe it off with a baby wipe or something. I have honestly never done anything more, its not even like wipe it up and occasionally hose it down like some products, its simple enough to keep clean that way. I wouldnt recomend purchasing it for eating out though. The carry case it comes with is ridiculously large, its just a big piece of vinyl to lure you into purchasing it, making it sound portable. The cooshie doesnt fold, doesnt roll up and doesnt become any smaller than its original size, so its just carrying it around with handles... I would still purchase it, and have used it at relatives houses... but wouldnt recomend it for eating out... unless you dont mind the lack of portability.Its so simple, yet so unique and ingenious. I deduct one star because it does ruin wooden furnature (my mother tried to use it without knowing that it does, and her furniture was destroyed) and because it doesnt fold or anything for easy portability, and because my daughter finds it a bit difficult to sit on it, she wiggles around alot until she finds "the spot", and sometimes her legs stick to it (like on leather seats) and she cries out "ouch!".

Over the last 3 years, two of our friends have borrowed one of ours and subsequently purchased one or two for their children.  Most of us have wood chairs, however they have fabric seats and wood backs.  None of us has had any damage to the wood finish.  None of the 6 boosters that we have between us and our friends have any missing chunks (as some have reported).  We have all owned them over a year, with ours being used the longest, around 3 years.  We were very sad to see that Baby's R Us store is no longer selling this seat, which is where we purchased our others and where our friends purchased theirs.  Their replacement version is from a different manufacturer and I did not like it, primarily because it was not cooshie, which to me, is the soft yet firm quality this seat.  I will purchase mine on-line until they reappear at a store where I can purchase a different color again.  In case you wonder why I am purchasing more... two friends in Canada have given me money to bring them back one on my next trip to the U.S. as they can't be found in Canada yet.", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Over 4 years have purchased 6 for us and friends kids', 'unixReviewTime': 1101600000, 'reviewTime': '11 28, 2004'}

He can sit in the chair without one, but he is so much more comfortable with his booster.  It also allows him to sit much higher in the chair which is great.
