My Poxie girl will play with anything and will play as long as you let her.Boo likes watching and chaseing the catnip bubbles but dislike it when they pop (because then he gets squirted with wet/cold liquid .. even if it\'s tiny droplets). Poxie walks into the shower and isn\'t as picky about getting her paws wet so she goes crazy for them. So, Poxie will play forever if you let her and Boo gives up after a while, which is normal habit with most toys anyway :)I adopted both of them from the pound (a year and half apart) and both were noted as being more skittish than "normal". Both of them don\'t like a whole flurry of bubbles drifting down on TOP of them and will startle or run away every once in a while. So, when we play and it\'s been a while since I brought out the bottle, I start as low or eye level to them as possible (but don\'t blow directly in their faces) until they get used to the bubbles.I\'m giving this four stars simply because the liquid "may cause stains" on carpet. So you might want to do a test swatch if you have really delicate fabrics.

My cats seem to enjoy the rare bubble that comes their way and like the smell of the open bottle, so we would probably be having a lot of fun with these if they actually worked.
