      "26: I have found that even I have trouble loosing these things if I buy them a dozen at a time\n",
      "27: Like another reviewer here, I am not all that happy about these not being manufactured in this country anymore and think it is a shame\n",
      "28: but what are you going to do?  I guess it is worth it if we can make the fat cats fatter\n",
      "29: I will note that when the company changed the manufacturing location, to save money I presume, I certainly did not see the price of these things, cheap though they  may be, going down any, for us, the consumer\n",
      "30: We were able to buy it for a much cheaper price\n",
      "31: these bic pens are great pens which come in a neatly designed box i use these pens in my business for customers to sign their receipts and work orders they last and work well\n",

      "61: There's not much to say about these, they're pens, right?  They last quite a while, they store well, and I like how they write\n",
      "62: If you don't use them for several months, you'll find that several pens do not actually write at all and you will need to throw them away\n",
      "63: I willm buy more for the sae or simiolar price in the future\n",

      "87: Nothing like writing out a character and looking at it and realizing that half the lines didn't make a mark\n",
      "88: Gets two stars because they're cheap and you could leave them out at a business and people wouldn't be very tempted to take them home\n",
      "89: Pens don't come much cheaper than this, and it shows in the quality of the product\n",
      "90: They seem to dry/clog up instantly, and it is impossible to maintain a train of thought with there constant ineptitude, grinding the gears to a halt\n",

      "2: Bic Pens: from plain (like these) to \"fancy\", they write, they write, they write -- they are inexpensive, seem to last a looong time, and create GREAT multiple copies because you press em as hard as you want and they write, they write, they write\n",
      "3: We play a lot of group games, which means we need a lot of pens, and that a lot of those pens walk off\n",
      "4: Works fine most of the time, blobs out ink other times, but hey, GREAT PRICE, and I've lost half of them already, so who cares?\n",

      "13: These pens are easy to handle, write well, and come in a nice shade of blue\n",
      "14: I personally don't mind  using them, I live with a few people in my house and my pens tend to get lost  quite often\n",
      "15: They go through a lot of pens - customers take them, bussers toss them, they drop them, etc\n",
      "16: BIC pens are pretty reliable for taking orders and are cheap enough they don't mind putting them down with credit card receipts\n",
      "17: Your basic pen in a high enough quantity that you don't mind if a few dozen go missing\n",
      "18: Used to purchase pens from costco and sams club but they wouldn't write on paper when written on top of glass\n",
      "19: these bic pens always work the best and the blue was just cheaper but is more vibrant color so works out well when signing paperwork\n",
      "20: Great cheap item so far every pen i have used has worked first try i would recommend buy this alot of pen for a great cheap price\n",
      "21: I think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems!  This is usually one product on which you can count, to not leak all over the place and still write nicely, and for a long time\n",
      "22: Its a Bic pen, but the price is right!  Ive purchased many times!  I use the pens everyday\n",
      "23: The cost of each pen is great, I don't mind lending these to someone that needs one\n",
      "24: I tend to lose a lot of pens before they run out of ink, so can't speak to how long they'll last, but I'm sure i'll be buying these again once i lose all 60 again\n",
      "25: Indeed, as another reviewer has stated, these pens have been around for almost ever\n",
      "26: I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff\n",
      "27: I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably, sure as the sun rises, there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil (I always keep several packages of pencils too\n",
      "28: I have the little twerps! And I don't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests\n",
      "29: which often happens, I am not out a lot of money and they are less likely to steal them as they do not really look all that cool nor do they have a lot of whistles and bells on them\n",
      "30: As an additional advantage, I do not mind writing short notes with them myself, and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk\n",
      "31: This is a pen we have used for several years\n",
      "32: They have a plain, cylindrical body, a thoroughly unsophisticated plastic cap, and the whole assembly is the same color as the ink contained within\n",
      "33: Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly\n",
      "34: These pens write cleanly, smoothly, are a joy to use,  and getting so many for such a decent price,  is such a gift, thank you so much for this product\n",
      "35: I will buy all ball pens in amazon in the future\n",
      "36: I like the new design and how comfortable they are to write with, but only annoyance is that the caps are SO hard to pull off initially!!  I had to keep twisting and tugging on the caps of all of the pens I've used to far\n",
      "37: So why buy a box of 60 pens, when it takes forever just to use up a single pen?There are lots of reasons, the biggest being the well known fact that once you set a pen down and look away they grow legs and walk off\n",
      "38: For you pen chewers out there you can chew away, and always have another in the box you can lend out without getting those looks (you know what I'm talking about)\n",
      "39: These pens will serve your check book well (does anyone still use those things? I do, but I'm old school like that), take great notes in school, and scribble a quick note at your desk without fuss\n",
      "40: America's favorite pen sold in the HUGE pack!  Great for that office or desk that can never seem to find a pen (like mine)\n",
      "41: Good Value, 60 smooth writing smudge free ink pens in a lightweight barrel with a removable cap\n",
      "42: I buy a big box of pens and keep some at home, in kitchen, by computer, books, in my bag, a few to give and forget aboutwhen someone asks to \"borrow a pen\",\n",
      "43: I would say that there are maybe 1-2 duds per pack of 60, but it was the cheapest pen I could find online, and much more reliable than freebie promotional pens\n",
      "44: So, the Bic Round Stick Pen Medium Point is a nice little pen!They&#8217;re not fancy, but I was tired of paying $4 for a 2-pen set from Walgreens/CVS/The Local Grocer and such and decided to go ahead and try these as they came 60 in a box&#8230; And so basically for pennies on the dollar I have enough pens that should last myself and my relatives (as they always seem to borrow my work supplies&#8230;) well throughout the year!They work fine, come with caps and so far have not bled out in my bag like some other cheaper pens of the past\n",
      "45: So, if you just want something to write with that doesn&#8217;t have to come with the bells and whistles of a personalized gold pen, or say a calligraphy pen set, then I think anyone would be satisfied with this offering from the folks at Bic\n",
      "46: five stars for the price, i got them very cheap;  with four  kids that use pens often  and loose them even more often the price was awesome; will be buying more later\n",
      "47: i was needing some basic  ink pens the bic did the trick  they are good ink pens  if you need basic writeing pens theses pen,s will do it\n",
      "48: What a good deal, with prime! Enough pens to keep my volleyball team writing away on their statistics sheets for a couple season, hopefully\n",
      "49: I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use\n",
      "50: I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!\n",
      "51: I don't like to pay an extreme price for pens but i expect them to work\n",
      "52: These fill the bill nicely\n",
      "53: Except that they work, even after sitting long periods of time!  I haven't had a single issue with any of these pens\n",
      "54: Great price, came quickly - so many pens leftover from my project (handing them out at a booth) that I'll be set for pens for a while :)\n",
      "55: Nice to have a bunch of low cost pens you can depend on!\n",
      "56: These BICs are my favorite pens to use, even if they aren't too fancy\n",
      "57: These pens were ordered for our church\n",
      "58: The price was very reasonable, and the pens work well\n",
      "59: I love the fact that 10 pens allows several throughout the house so they're always available when you need it - especially by the phones with a pad\n",
      "60: Didn't like it at first but had to adjust after using so many 'bad' pens\n",
      "61: 6 (7 if you round) cents a pen\n",
      "62: Good price for the amount of pens you're buying\n",
      "63: We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens, with the white barrel, medium or fine points\n",
      "64: I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design\n",
      "65: It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color\n",
      "66: The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white\n",
      "67: I bought a pack of blue pens at an office supply place\n",
      "68: I manage a small business and have a great need of pens, to save money I was buying cheap pens but luckily got these\n",
      "69: Lots of pens that can be used for a life time, but\n",
      "70: The package contained 10 pens\n",
      "71: I love these pens: I can pull a pen out of my pocket, and have it work\n",
      "72: You can even fling the pen caps! I love these pens but whatever you do, don't put them in the freezer\n",
      "73: They are black ink pens that I love to use when writing down things\n",
      "74: Should've bought post-it notes with them\n",
      "75: For the price and all I wasn't expecting much but these pens work great right out of the box\n",
      "76: The price of pens was significant reason for my purchase\n",
      "77: I bought these pens in order reach the limit for my free shipping at Amazon\n",
      "78: I bought these to get over the $25 threshold for free shipping\n",
      "79: As far as pens go, these are perfect for having around when you need one, but don't care when you misplace/lose it\n",
      "80: These would be great for any environment that consumes a lot of pens\n",
      "81: Definitely recommended if you have cashiers at work who chew through pens at an astonishing rate\n",
      "82: good  pens don't love how ya have to pull off the cap instead of click it open but they write well\n",
      "83: I am making sporadic edits to a paper with these pieces of trash and they can't even make it from the top of the page to the bottom\n",
      "84: Thus, the cheaply made pen is purchased at an inflated rate, performs cheaply, and then makes it's most prominent impact on the world--not as a writing device, but as another poisonous piece of plastic, sent to join a landfill or float in an ocean: either way, rotting the earth\n",
      "85: The Bic Round Stic pen is the cancer that keeps on giving; I wouldn't wish this junk product on my worst enemy, and I encourage anyone interested in giving this shameful company any money for this, or another, disposable piece of garbage to strongly reconsider and fork up the extra dough to purchase something that is made with actual quality\n",
      "86: There are a lot of places these pens can be shoved, but they only belong in one dark, smelly hole--and it ain't a landfill\n",
      "87: If you want to have enough of a nice normal no fuss pen that writes smoothly to get through the zombie apocalypse, if you need to get a crowd jotting things down or if you have to keep a stash of pens because you are surrounded by office supplies thieves then this is the affordable pack of lovely blue pens for you\n",

      "36. I like the new design and how comfortable they are to write with, but only annoyance is that the caps are SO hard to pull off initially!!  I had to keep twisting and tugging on the caps of all of the pens I've used to far\n",
      "37. So why buy a box of 60 pens, when it takes forever just to use up a single pen?There are lots of reasons, the biggest being the well known fact that once you set a pen down and look away they grow legs and walk off\n",
      "38. For you pen chewers out there you can chew away, and always have another in the box you can lend out without getting those looks (you know what I'm talking about)\n",
      "39. These pens will serve your check book well (does anyone still use those things? I do, but I'm old school like that), take great notes in school, and scribble a quick note at your desk without fuss\n",
      "40. America's favorite pen sold in the HUGE pack!  Great for that office or desk that can never seem to find a pen (like mine)\n",
      "41. Good Value, 60 smooth writing smudge free ink pens in a lightweight barrel with a removable cap\n",
      "42. I buy a big box of pens and keep some at home, in kitchen, by computer, books, in my bag, a few to give and forget aboutwhen someone asks to \"borrow a pen\",\n",
      "43. I would say that there are maybe 1-2 duds per pack of 60, but it was the cheapest pen I could find online, and much more reliable than freebie promotional pens\n",
      "44. So, the Bic Round Stick Pen Medium Point is a nice little pen!They&#8217;re not fancy, but I was tired of paying $4 for a 2-pen set from Walgreens/CVS/The Local Grocer and such and decided to go ahead and try these as they came 60 in a box&#8230; And so basically for pennies on the dollar I have enough pens that should last myself and my relatives (as they always seem to borrow my work supplies&#8230;) well throughout the year!They work fine, come with caps and so far have not bled out in my bag like some other cheaper pens of the past\n",
      "45. So, if you just want something to write with that doesn&#8217;t have to come with the bells and whistles of a personalized gold pen, or say a calligraphy pen set, then I think anyone would be satisfied with this offering from the folks at Bic\n",
      "46. five stars for the price, i got them very cheap;  with four  kids that use pens often  and loose them even more often the price was awesome; will be buying more later\n",
      "47. i was needing some basic  ink pens the bic did the trick  they are good ink pens  if you need basic writeing pens theses pen,s will do it\n",
      "48. What a good deal, with prime! Enough pens to keep my volleyball team writing away on their statistics sheets for a couple season, hopefully\n",
      "49. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use\n",
      "50. I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!\n",
      "51. I don't like to pay an extreme price for pens but i expect them to work\n",
      "52. These fill the bill nicely\n",
      "53. Except that they work, even after sitting long periods of time!  I haven't had a single issue with any of these pens\n",
      "54. Great price, came quickly - so many pens leftover from my project (handing them out at a booth) that I'll be set for pens for a while :)\n",
      "55. Nice to have a bunch of low cost pens you can depend on!\n",
      "56. These BICs are my favorite pens to use, even if they aren't too fancy\n",
      "57. These pens were ordered for our church\n",
      "58. The price was very reasonable, and the pens work well\n",
      "59. I love the fact that 10 pens allows several throughout the house so they're always available when you need it - especially by the phones with a pad\n",
      "60. Didn't like it at first but had to adjust after using so many 'bad' pens\n",
      "61. 6 (7 if you round) cents a pen\n",
      "62. Good price for the amount of pens you're buying\n",
      "63. We all are familiar with the Bic round stic pens, with the white barrel, medium or fine points\n",
      "64. I decided to buy this 60 pack when I saw that the pens had a new design\n",
      "65. It says white barrel in the description, but I hoped to get this new color\n",
      "66. The pen now comes in a clear blue tinted barrel so you can see the ink inside, and it looks more interesting than the traditional white\n",
      "67. I bought a pack of blue pens at an office supply place\n",
      "68. Don't tape them to spoons\n",
      "69. I manage a small business and have a great need of pens, to save money I was buying cheap pens but luckily got these\n",
      "70. Lots of pens that can be used for a life time, but\n",
      "71. I love these pens: I can pull a pen out of my pocket, and have it work\n",
      "72. These pens will rock your socks\n",
      "73. You can even fling the pen caps! I love these pens but whatever you do, don't put them in the freezer\n",
      "74. They are black ink pens that I love to use when writing down things\n",
      "75. Should've bought post-it notes with them\n",
      "76. For the price and all I wasn't expecting much but these pens work great right out of the box\n",
      "77. The price of pens was significant reason for my purchase\n",
      "78. I bought these pens in order reach the limit for my free shipping at Amazon\n",
      "79. Used them for a baby shower\n",
      "80. I bought these to get over the $25 threshold for free shipping\n",
      "81. As far as pens go, these are perfect for having around when you need one, but don't care when you misplace/lose it\n",
      "82. These would be great for any environment that consumes a lot of pens\n",
      "83. Definitely recommended if you have cashiers at work who chew through pens at an astonishing rate\n",
      "84. good  pens don't love how ya have to pull off the cap instead of click it open but they write well\n",
      "85. If you want to have enough of a nice normal no fuss pen that writes smoothly to get through the zombie apocalypse, if you need to get a crowd jotting things down or if you have to keep a stash of pens because you are surrounded by office supplies thieves then this is the affordable pack of lovely blue pens for you\n",
      "86. Unless you prefer black ink, then keep moving (but I am sure BIC makes a lovely black pen as well)\n",

      "1. The package contained 10 pens\n",
      "2. I am making sporadic edits to a paper with these pieces of trash and they can't even make it from the top of the page to the bottom\n",
      "3. Thus, the cheaply made pen is purchased at an inflated rate, performs cheaply, and then makes it's most prominent impact on the world--not as a writing device, but as another poisonous piece of plastic, sent to join a landfill or float in an ocean: either way, rotting the earth\n",
      "4. The Bic Round Stic pen is the cancer that keeps on giving; I wouldn't wish this junk product on my worst enemy, and I encourage anyone interested in giving this shameful company any money for this, or another, disposable piece of garbage to strongly reconsider and fork up the extra dough to purchase something that is made with actual quality\n",
