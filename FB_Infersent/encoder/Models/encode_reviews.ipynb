      "4: At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls\n",
      "5: I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension\n",
