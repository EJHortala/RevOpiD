Similar to review 1 - Much needed tool for anyone that has a truck. Fits in any location and allows you to store equipment securely. :
1. This is a must have for pickup truck owners.  The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place.  The ratchet part is very well made.  You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving.  Have had no problems at all.....
2. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.
3. Easy to snap in and take out.  Holds things very securely in the bed of the truck.  Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis.
4. This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
5. This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed.It,however,is a low cost,durable multi use product.I bought two of these and use them to support my slide-out on my Lance truck camper when extended.It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity.Highly recommend this product.

Similar to review 2 - I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust. :
1. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
2. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
3. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.
4. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
5. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

Similar to review 3 - Good Cargo Bar.  Doesn't get excessively tight in my truck (thus the 4 stars).  Good construction, use it as a cargo separator under my tonneau cover. :

3. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...

Similar to review 4 - This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds. The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs. The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened. :

3. Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.

5. When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced.  The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly.  I do not recommend this cargo bar.

Similar to review 5 - Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months. It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider. You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click. Might break a weld on the inside of your bed.This thing was a steal for $25 and free shipping. :

Similar to review 6 - My husband asked for a similar item as a gift but I wanted to see reviews so I shopped Amazon. This one had one of the best reviews and so far it doing the job. :
1. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars.
2. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.
3. I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup and worked great.  I should've had one these years ago.  Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady.  I would recommend.
4. Great product, works real well.I just love shopping at Amazon,because they have so many great merchants.The shipping speed was terrific and the product was awesome thank you very much!!see you soon!
5. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.

Similar to review 7 - The cargo bar is great. It is of high quality and held my cargo in the bed of my truck from Colorado to Southern California.Bob :
1. This product works very well and stores behind the seat of my Chevy Colorado pickup. It provides a sturdy anchor for my cargo bed contents and will hold a mower right where you want it.

4. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar.
5. The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted. It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner.) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it. Also the finish seems to be good quality.

3. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
4. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
5. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

Similar to review 10 - Holds things inplace, and very easy to use. Seems to be built very well too.I would buy this again. :
1. Arrived as promissed and in good condition, performs as advertised and fits my need as was hoped for. A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality.
2. Easy to install, has worked well so far. It fit my pick-up very well and I would recommend this product. In my opinion a good value as well.
3. Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy. You can tell by the feel and weight that it's cheap, but it does what it's suppose to.. It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much.
4. I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works. Once secured in place it stays there. Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove. I'd buy it again. Outstanding price.
5. It works well on my '07 Tacoma. It is easy to use and stays in place without damage. The price is right too.

Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
2. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
3. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
4. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
5. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

Similar to review 12 - This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar. :

2. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.

3. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars.

Similar to review 13 - My husband ordered this to keep his ice chest from sliding in the back of his work truck (full-size Chevrolet). The product is cheaply made and would not stay locked in place on the desired adjustment. We returned the item and paid more for a better made product he found in a store. :

3. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.

Similar to review 15 - I would absolutely purchase again.  I bought a more expensive one and returned it.  I have a Ford F150.  Enjoy :

2. It's one of those you get what you pay for. I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks. This was more sturdy and fit my needs better.
3. This bar is easy to adjust and the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly.  It works great on my Ford Ranger pickup.  I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!
4. This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks).I drive a 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty.
5. It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

Similar to review 16 - I received the order promptly but the ratcheting device did not function as well as I had expected. It has worked well since being put in place. :
1. This item was horrible.  It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it.  The locking mechanism simply would not hold.  I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off.  The device is not worth it.  Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy.  You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk.
2. I ordered two.  One is broken. It is to late to get a replacement. I didn't open the box until I needed them. Open your box ASAP.The one works ok.
3. This is great. I have a screw type one and it is a pain. This one works great every time. Keeps my load in place. It has not failed me yet.
4. I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded and difficult to extend constently. This is  the first ratcheting cargo bar that I have had and I recomend it highly very easy to adjust and the ratchet action makes it very easy to use.
5. I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350.  The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place.  I would recommend trying a different cargo bar.

1. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this...

5. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

Similar to review 18 - I purchase this item several weeks ago and it works as advertised. It's worth the money paid and I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed. :

3. I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup and worked great.  I should've had one these years ago.  Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady.  I would recommend.
4. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.
5. This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years. I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out. You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed. Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED.

Similar to review 19 - The ratchet part works great. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place. :
1. I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells. only had the for short time but I do like them.I would recommend them to a friend.the shipping time was less than expected. overall very happy with product and service.
2. The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer) and consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls.Other than that, it works perfectly.............

4. This is a must have for pickup truck owners.  The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place.  The ratchet part is very well made.  You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving.  Have had no problems at all.....
5. easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it.  Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on and it took forever to get right and didn't seem to hold as well.

Similar to review 20 - I don't know how good this product will be on holding back heavy items, but it works well on garden flowers they all stead in place with this bar. very nice. :
1. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet.  This thing is heavy duty and works excellent .  I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason.  If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it.

4. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.

It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.

Similar to review 22 - The &#34;feet&#34; on this bar slides off the truck bed sides and makes it worthless.When the ratchet is extended, the mechanism for that ends up out of arms reach when standing outside the truck. :
1. The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center. Guess where it ends up when you try to use it? In the middle of the bed. I am just about 6 feet tall and I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck. So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck. Waste of time and money! If the mech was closer to one side this would be a great product!
2. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
3. Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.
4. Spreads and retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner. Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC and back. Just crank down on it.
5. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

Similar to review 23 - I bought this, and it will not stay where I put it, and Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy! :
1. This item was horrible.  It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it.  The locking mechanism simply would not hold.  I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off.  The device is not worth it.  Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy.  You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk.
2. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.
3. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.
4. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
5. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar.

1. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.

4. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...
5. I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust.

Similar to review 25 - I have been using it and it works very well.  I have a bed cover on and it makes it easier to carry stuff from the store without having the stuff slide forward. :
1. It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!.

3. I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells. only had the for short time but I do like them.I would recommend them to a friend.the shipping time was less than expected. overall very happy with product and service.

5. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.

2. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.

Similar to review 29 - This is the most worthless item I believe I have ever purchased from Amazon, or anywhere else in many years. I would have returned it, but it took me a month  before trying it out. You lock it in place and hit a bump with the truck and it slips back two or three teeth and drops to the bottom of the truck bed. Didn't look, but probably made in China or some other third world country to specs designed by someone with a GED. :

4. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.

Similar to review 30 - Nice cargo bar for the price. Easy to use and racheting works good. Careful of those fingers as they can get smashed! :
1. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet.  This thing is heavy duty and works excellent .  I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason.  If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it.
2. Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home. LOL. Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out. Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one. It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it...now I need a topper!
3. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.
4. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything.

Similar to review 32 - easy to adjust and puts enough tension on the sides of the bed to keep your stuff back at the tailgate where you can get to it.  Used to have one of the ones that used threaded rod to unscrew to put the tension on and it took forever to get right and didn't seem to hold as well. :
1. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...
2. I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells. only had the for short time but I do like them.I would recommend them to a friend.the shipping time was less than expected. overall very happy with product and service.
3. This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds. The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs. The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened.
4. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
5. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.

Similar to review 33 - This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed.It,however,is a low cost,durable multi use product.I bought two of these and use them to support my slide-out on my Lance truck camper when extended.It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity.Highly recommend this product. :
1. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.
2. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
3. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.

5. I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust.

Similar to review 34 - Easy to snap in and take out.  Holds things very securely in the bed of the truck.  Not heavy duty, but does secure almost anything that you use on a daily basis. :
1. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.
2. The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted. It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner.) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it. Also the finish seems to be good quality.
3. This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds. The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs. The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened.
4. If you are looking for a heavy duty piece of equipment...keep looking. BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight and simple this may be a good choice. Perfect for keeping stuff from sliding around the bed of a truck during normal driving.
5. This is a must have for pickup truck owners.  The bar is easy to adjust and with the rubber feet stays firmly in place.  The ratchet part is very well made.  You can secure this and know for sure that your cargo is not moving.  Have had no problems at all.....

Similar to review 35 - I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars. :
1. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar.

3. It's one of those you get what you pay for. I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks. This was more sturdy and fit my needs better.
4. Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home. LOL. Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out. Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one. It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it...now I need a topper!

4. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
5. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

Similar to review 38 - Pretty handy, It's not very sturdy. You can tell by the feel and weight that it's cheap, but it does what it's suppose to.. It's great for short trips where you don't want something sliding around too much. :
1. It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!.
2. Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two). So please get familiar with it before you need it.It is made of good quality material and workmanship. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating.
3. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet.  This thing is heavy duty and works excellent .  I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason.  If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it.
4. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.

Similar to review 39 - I was expecting something more sturdy.  This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall.  It may function to restrain small light items but not much more :

I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

Similar to review 41 - This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks.  I even use it to secure a line of grocery bags on the ride home from the market.  The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position.  It's a bit tricky to get used too. :
1. Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home. LOL. Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out. Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one. It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it...now I need a topper!
2. It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!.
3. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
4. This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
5. Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.

Similar to review 42 - will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can and it still will not hole very good. :
1. Cargo bar will not tighten tight enough to hold its self up let alone holding cargo.Ratchet unit slips when you put a load on it. Won't work for what I had in mind for it.I might be able to find something it will work with
2. The ratchet part works great. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place.
3. This seems to work fine so far.  I haven't had any problems with it, but it's a little difficult to get it to release some times.
4. I was expecting something more sturdy.  This item is a bit flimsy, the ratchet isn't quite as easy to use as expected, tends to slip on the bed wall.  It may function to restrain small light items but not much more
5. Defective ratchet.  Will not hold in place.  Perhaps I just got a lemon.  When it is tightened it just pops off the gear and will not create enough tension to hold in place.

Similar to review 43 - Easy to install, has worked well so far. It fit my pick-up very well and I would recommend this product. In my opinion a good value as well. :
1. Arrived as promissed and in good condition, performs as advertised and fits my need as was hoped for. A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality.
2. I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works. Once secured in place it stays there. Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove. I'd buy it again. Outstanding price.
3. I received it fast, works as advertised...good  quality....a good value for the cost.,.would recommend it to friends  it is  great
4. The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted. It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner.) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it. Also the finish seems to be good quality.
5. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.

5. It's one of those you get what you pay for. I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks. This was more sturdy and fit my needs better.

4. Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world. Easy to use, stays locked tight. Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps. After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it. My cargo held tight. Overall great product and fast shipping

3. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars.
4. My husband asked for a similar item as a gift but I wanted to see reviews so I shopped Amazon. This one had one of the best reviews and so far it doing the job.
5. If you are like me, I just through items in the back of my truck and hope they are still there wherever I'm going.  But with this Ratchet Cargo Bar, I can still through things, but I can now through them in the right place.  Great Product and seller. A+++++++++++++

Similar to review 48 - Cargo bar will not tighten tight enough to hold its self up let alone holding cargo.Ratchet unit slips when you put a load on it. Won't work for what I had in mind for it.I might be able to find something it will work with :
1. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...
2. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate.

Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.
3. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.

Similar to review 50 - This bar fits my Dodge Ram 1500 fine and seems to have plenty of strength. It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home. My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy. I have already pinched my fingers in it several times and have only owned it for about 3 weeks. My advice is to just be careful or wear gloves while adjusting it. :
1. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.

3. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.

5. I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust.

3. I have been using this for almost a year now and it works great.  It is really easy to adjust and move around.  Never had a problem with it slipping or not unlocking or anything.  I am happy with my purchase for sure.  It fits my 6.5' F150 truck bed perfectly.
4. Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months. It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider. You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click. Might break a weld on the inside of your bed.This thing was a steal for $25 and free shipping.
5. It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!!

You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk.
3. This is great. I have a screw type one and it is a pain. This one works great every time. Keeps my load in place. It has not failed me yet.
4. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.

Similar to review 53 - ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"! :

3. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.

I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened.

Similar to review 56 - I bought this for a trip this past summer to keep things from moving in the back of the pickup and worked great.  I should've had one these years ago.  Keeps items from moving around and holds them steady.  I would recommend. :
1. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars.
2. This bar is easy to adjust and the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly.  It works great on my Ford Ranger pickup.  I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!
3. I purchase this item several weeks ago and it works as advertised. It's worth the money paid and I love it because it hold the item loaded in the rear in my truck bed.
4. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
5. Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home. LOL. Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out. Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one. It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it...now I need a topper!

Similar to review 57 - This is great. I have a screw type one and it is a pain. This one works great every time. Keeps my load in place. It has not failed me yet. :
1. This item was horrible.  It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it.  The locking mechanism simply would not hold.  I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off.  The device is not worth it.  Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy.  You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk.
2. The ratchet part works great. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place.
3. I ordered two.  One is broken. It is to late to get a replacement. I didn't open the box until I needed them. Open your box ASAP.The one works ok.
4. Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two). So please get familiar with it before you need it.It is made of good quality material and workmanship. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating.
5. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.

Similar to review 58 - Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product. :
1. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
2. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
3. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
4. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.
5. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

Similar to review 59 - I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350.  The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place.  I would recommend trying a different cargo bar. :
1. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.
2. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...

Similar to review 60 - A little on the flimsy side. A bit weak but the price is cheap. If your moving anything heavy don't count on this bar. If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set. :
1. It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!.

3. This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.

5. This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks.  I even use it to secure a line of grocery bags on the ride home from the market.  The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position.  It's a bit tricky to get used too.

Similar to review 61 - I have been using this for almost a year now and it works great.  It is really easy to adjust and move around.  Never had a problem with it slipping or not unlocking or anything.  I am happy with my purchase for sure.  It fits my 6.5' F150 truck bed perfectly. :

2. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.

Similar to review 63 - Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet.  This thing is heavy duty and works excellent .

5. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.

Similar to review 65 - I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works. Once secured in place it stays there. Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove. I'd buy it again. Outstanding price. :
1. It's one of those you get what you pay for. I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks. This was more sturdy and fit my needs better.
2. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them.

3. Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world. Easy to use, stays locked tight. Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps. After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it. My cargo held tight. Overall great product and fast shipping
4. This expandable bar is intended to secure cargo in a pick-up truck bed.It,however,is a low cost,durable multi use product.I bought two of these and use them to support my slide-out on my Lance truck camper when extended.It expands to 70 inches where as other products costing twice as much do not have this range and capacity.Highly recommend this product.

Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar.
5. This bar is easy to adjust and the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly.  It works great on my Ford Ranger pickup.  I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!

Similar to review 67 - Arrived as promissed and in good condition, performs as advertised and fits my need as was hoped for. A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality. :
1. Easy to install, has worked well so far. It fit my pick-up very well and I would recommend this product. In my opinion a good value as well.
2. Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two). So please get familiar with it before you need it.It is made of good quality material and workmanship. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating.
3. Bought this to use in the back of my Chevy Silverado.  The bar feels solid.  The ratcheting system appears solid, is easy to operate, and operates smoothly.  If I had to think of a weakness...if I was the designer of this tool, I would have tried to figure out a way to put the ratchet in the middle of the bar.  When you hold it up to crank it tight, the bar is awkward to hold because it is off balance.  So petty, I know.  I can't comment on how it stands up to weather, as my bed is covered.  Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.
4. I've had several different types of cargo retaining mechanisms, but this one works. Once secured in place it stays there. Easy to place in the truck and easy to remove. I'd buy it again. Outstanding price.
5. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars.

Similar to review 68 - Missing a screw at one end now I have to go to store and find one to fit! Packing should have been better. Ends were open. :
1. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.
2. Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world. Easy to use, stays locked tight. Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps. After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it. My cargo held tight. Overall great product and fast shipping
3. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.
4. I ordered two.  One is broken. It is to late to get a replacement. I didn't open the box until I needed them. Open your box ASAP.The one works ok.
5. Used this in my 2005 Tundra for a few months. It is ok for what it's intended to do, which is be a lightweight cargo divider. You have to make sure you don't ratchet this thing down too hard, if you do, you will regret that last click. Might break a weld on the inside of your bed.This thing was a steal for $25 and free shipping.

Similar to review 69 - This seems well built but my only complaint is that It doesn't seem to have the exact right adjustment for a tight fit in the bed of my pickup (almost like the size is between two clicks).I drive a 2012 Ford F-250 Super Duty. :
1. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
2. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

4. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
5. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.

Similar to review 70 - If you are looking for a heavy duty piece of equipment...keep looking. BUT, if you are looking for something practical, lightweight and simple this may be a good choice. Perfect for keeping stuff from sliding around the bed of a truck during normal driving. :
1. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...
2. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.
3. The KargoBar does exactly what I wanted. It secures loads in the bed of my Toyota truck (with plastic bedliner.) It is easy to use and I had no problem setting it up the first time I needed it. Also the finish seems to be good quality.
4. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet.  This thing is heavy duty and works excellent .  I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason.  If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it.
5. Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home. LOL. Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out. Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one. It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it...now I need a topper!

Similar to review 71 - This item was horrible.  It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it.  The locking mechanism simply would not hold.  I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off.  The device is not worth it.  Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy.  You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk. :
1. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!

Similar to review 73 - The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer) and consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls.Other than that, it works perfectly............. :
1. This device works well, especially on narrower truck beds. The ratchet mechanism works better than the screw or collet designs. The ratcheting lever works exactly the same as those found on cargo straps. It is no more hazardous to fingers than any of the many tools that have pinching hazards. The ratchet increments are wide enough that you may need to test where along the the bed wall the bar can be most effectively tightened.
2. Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.
3. The ratchet part works great. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place.
4. When extended to the width of a full-size bed, the bar's strength is greatly reduced.  The ratcheting mechanism is very rough and requires some sort of ritual sacrifice in order to make it work properly.  I do not recommend this cargo bar.
5. The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center. Guess where it ends up when you try to use it? In the middle of the bed. I am just about 6 feet tall and I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck. So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck. Waste of time and money! If the mech was closer to one side this would be a great product!

Similar to review 74 - Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak. :

Similar to review 79 - If you are like me, I just through items in the back of my truck and hope they are still there wherever I'm going.  But with this Ratchet Cargo Bar, I can still through things, but I can now through them in the right place.  Great Product and seller. A+++++++++++++ :
1. It's one of those you get what you pay for. I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks. This was more sturdy and fit my needs better.
2. I had a need for one of these one day and my brother-in-law said I could use his......that was all it took, I liked it so well I ordered two of them. His was a few years old, mine had a little better design improvement(racheting handle). If you have a pick up truck,this item is a must, they are extremely durable, and I like the fact that it really stretches out there.You will be impressed at the bracing strenght of one of these Keeper Cargo bars.
3. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...
4. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar.
5. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.

2. This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
3. This cargo bar can hold back anything I put in the bed of my truck with no problem, it is sturdy and easy to use. Without lubrication it still works flawlessly after a couple months of use. I would absolutely recommend this product for anyone who wants to keep things in one spot in their bed or for anyone who doesn't have a tailgate.
4. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

Similar to review 81 - Spreads and retracts easily but has a tendency to slide on plastic bed liner. Has held 125# generator in place from Texas to DC and back. Just crank down on it. :
1. Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.
2. Ok, I was using a twist version of cargo bar that I did not like because it was a little cumbersome to put in. I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click. After placing in position I found it was not as sturdy as the rotating bar I was using, but went ahead and left the Ratcheting bar in place. After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
3. I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust.
4. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.

Similar to review 82 - I often travel with a slide in camper on my pickup and when at a campground, take the camper off.  That leaves me without a tailgate.  I use two of these to surround anything I place in the pickup bed to keep stuff from sliding out of the pickup. :

Similar to review 83 - Had this a long time now, catching up on Amazon reviewing, no loosening up of ratchet over time, does just what you would want it to. :
1. This item was horrible.  It was unable to stay in the locked position even with no stress being placed on it.  The locking mechanism simply would not hold.  I tried to install it in several locations and it would just pop off.  The device is not worth it.  Thank goodness for the Amazon return policy.  You would be better off avoiding the purchase of this piece of junk.
2. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.
3. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.
4. Don't understand some other reviews stating problem with catching fingers in ratchet.  This thing is heavy duty and works excellent .  I quests your fingers could get caught if you were not paying attention, but you could get hit by a bus for the same reason.  If you want a quality, heavy duty cargo bar at a good price, this is it.
5. I bought this, and it will not stay where I put it, and Im only out about a foot, keeps "popping" out! Thank God for Amazon return policy!

4. The ratchet mechanism is right in the middle of the bar instead of off center. Guess where it ends up when you try to use it? In the middle of the bed. I am just about 6 feet tall and I can't reach the ratchet standing on the side of the truck. So, every time I want to use this I need to get in the back of the truck. Waste of time and money! If the mech was closer to one side this would be a great product!
5. This bar fits my Dodge Ram 1500 fine and seems to have plenty of strength. It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home. My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy. I have already pinched my fingers in it several times and have only owned it for about 3 weeks. My advice is to just be careful or wear gloves while adjusting it.

Similar to review 85 - I had to return one already because it broke.  Lets hope this second one lives up to it's potential.  Great for keeping the ice chest at the back of the truck.  Keeps it from sliding around and breaking my fishing rods :-) :

Really, I couldn't ask for anything more, especially for the low price!  I may buy a second one.  One high, one low.  Highly recommend.
5. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!

Similar to review 87 - definitely worth the price.  just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release. :
1. Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two). So please get familiar with it before you need it.It is made of good quality material and workmanship. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating.

3. I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells. only had the for short time but I do like them.I would recommend them to a friend.the shipping time was less than expected. overall very happy with product and service.

4. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.

After 200 miles of driving, bumpy roads, hills, ext.... it is still in place and working. I must note that I have a bed rug, and topper. So no slipping would occur so long as the ratchet holds. I would be on the fence to recommend this product. It will work, but not as tight as the turn stile.Update 05/22/13: OK been using for a while now, and find it is suffice to hold a good size tool box on wheels in place at the front of the box. No slipping or loosening has occurred in the 5,000 miles with this product. I would recommend this product, it does what it says, bounced to 4 star.
2. This was an early Fathers Day gift for my husband, and he couldn't be happier! Easy to use, love the ratchet instead of a twist and lock,held the load in the truck without shifting when we went camping (literally 40 miles of bad road), good pads on ends so truck bed is protected.The item was shipped and received as promised, good packaging. I highly recommend this Cargo Keeper Bar.
3. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.  It's easy to set up, easy to remove and adds a great measure of safety to moving gas cans as they can't flop around in the bed.  I used to use a bed extender on a Honda Ridgeline and it was O.K. as would any extender be on any pickup but extenders don't give the ability to draw whatever you're hauling tight to the tailgate.  This also has a secondary use--you can use it to reach to the area closest the back window to drag stuff to the tailgate area saving yourself climbing into the bed.
4. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.  Instructions are too often written by professors of design engineering.  A bit of screwing around and you'll master it.  Of course once you know how to use it, does not mean others can, makes it difficult to quickly steal compare to others I've seen on friend's trucks.  When not in use, it fits behind my seat in the regular cab (unfortunately always stuffed) without stealing any space.  Cannot believe that there are actually some poor reviews.  Quality of manufacture is excellent, it's very strong and the mechanism operates smoothly.  I'm not really well off so I'm careful with my money.  Sometimes you can get more for less; so, if you want a for-real genuine bargin, don't waste money on more expensive ones that do exactly the same thing and just aren't any better, get this baby.  Use the savings for gasoline (this 65 yr. driver's curse).  Thanks Amazon! It was actually cheaper to purchase through USA & US Post & taxes than to buy the same one from a store in Canada.
5. Just made the move to a pick up truck from a more car like vehicle and was having a bit of trouble getting the groceries home. LOL. Stuff sliding all over the place and getting difficult to get out. Someone recommended a cargo bar and I bought this one. It was very easy to install (old lady here) and it works very nicely. Even held steady my load of bags of soil from the depot Glad to have it...now I need a topper!

Similar to review 90 - work great :
1. They work just as described. Very useful and dependable.I am very pleased with them, and I recommend them highly.
2. I received it fast, works as advertised...good  quality....a good value for the cost.,.would recommend it to friends  it is  great
3. What can I say just a perfect design works excellent. The quality is there,  and the ratchet works very well.
4. Holds things inplace, and very easy to use. Seems to be built very well too.I would buy this again.
5. will not get tight enough to hold, I ratchet down as far as i can and it still will not hole very good.

Similar to review 91 - This seems to work fine so far.  I haven't had any problems with it, but it's a little difficult to get it to release some times. :
1. This is great. I have a screw type one and it is a pain. This one works great every time. Keeps my load in place. It has not failed me yet.
2. Perfect for my needs -- I was a little concerned by the "pinching" reviews, but I had no problems in that regards.Super value
3. Although it does get the eventually done, it is a bit clumsy and hard to learn at first. It took me a few tries to get it to open correctly. If you are in a hurry it may slow you down or even give you a pinch (or two). So please get familiar with it before you need it.It is made of good quality material and workmanship. So it's sturdy enough to take a beating.
4. Great item , best one I have ever used. Very high quality item . I have had no problems with it. Stays in place very well.
5. This bar is pretty flimsy and difficult to release it will not hold anything stable that has any weight to it .

Similar to review 92 - I`ve owned cargo bars in the past but they were threaded and difficult to extend constently. This is  the first ratcheting cargo bar that I have had and I recomend it highly very easy to adjust and the ratchet action makes it very easy to use. :
1. This cargo bar is well made and capable of holding almost any size/weight load in place. However, it is a bit heavy and the ratchet engage/release could be easier to operate. After using it for a month or so I lost it (don't ask) and came back to buy another one.  After reading many reviews, I opted for the screw-type bar and am glad I did. Its lighter and quicker and easier to install and move.
2. I just received 2 ratcheting cargo bars and I am just as quickly returning them back to Amazon.  The product was literally "Made in Taiwan", need I say more?  It is flimsy when extended to fit a regular size truck bed (F-150 crew).  The ratcheting mechanism does not stay securely even when the ratchet is locked.  I would not trust this cargo bar for any cargo in my truck bed.  I was looking for a sturdy, quality made cargo restraint bar and this is not it.
3. Even though I havent used this on my truckbed ive used it for military cargo going halfway around the world. Easy to use, stays locked tight. Its as simple if not easier than a cargo strap being no straps. After the cargo arrived I opened up the unit and lone behold its still right where I left it. My cargo held tight. Overall great product and fast shipping
4. I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells. only had the for short time but I do like them.I would recommend them to a friend.the shipping time was less than expected. overall very happy with product and service.
5. I bought this item to keep things from rattling around in the back of my F350.  The ratcheting mechanism slips when it is torqued enough to stay in place.  I would recommend trying a different cargo bar.

Similar to review 93 - It's a little bit on the flimsy side, but I does section your truck bed out to help keep your groceries from not rolling around back there. I wouldn't really use it to support anything heavy but to keep stuff from rolling around, it's great!. :
1. This neat little device  works great to secure load while in the back of PU trucks.  I even use it to secure a line of grocery bags on the ride home from the market.  The only thing I find a little difficult is releasing it from the secured position.  It's a bit tricky to get used too.
2. I'm fairly pleased with this cargo bar. It works as intended - one thing I didn't think about and am not sure if other bars do this... Sideways movement - yes it held my cargo up against the wall of the truck bed but, the box slid from side to side - I didn't think to angle it or anything. Angling probably would fix that - some bars probably have a cross bar for this - something to think about. Also - don't get your fingers pinched in the ratcheting mechanism - I can easily see that happening...
3. A little on the flimsy side. A bit weak but the price is cheap. If your moving anything heavy don't count on this bar. If you want to secure your groceries in the family SUV, your all set.
4. This product is trash. it might work in a mini truck to keep shopping bags in place but thats about it. I have a full size truck and when the bar is extended to fit the truck bed it is flimzy and weak the ratchet is also a weak point. the bar would never hold back any type of weight in a full size truck.
5. I'm curious about how the folks who gave bad reviews are using this product.  I've been happy with it in my F350 crew cab.  I can see the "risk" of pinching is there but that's never been an issue for me.  At full extension needed for my bed, there's a little bend in the bar but it still holds firmly on my Rhino lined bed walls.  I suspect a slippery plastic bed wall would require more pressure to hold firmly and thus not work as well thus the comments of needing a finer ratchet to make that little bit more extension.No regrets from me on this purchase.

Similar to review 94 - I received the cargo bar and installed on my truck.I was disappointed in the bar diameter and overall durability.I would recommend you keep looking for a sturdier cargo bar.I prefer those used on semi's as they can handle more weight. :

3. It's one of those you get what you pay for. I ordered it and when I got it, I felt it was cheaply made and would probably work better in a small truck rather than a full size truck like mine. I needed something more heavy duty so I returned it and ordered the Heininger 4016 HitchMate Cargo Stabilizer Bar for Full-Size Trucks. This was more sturdy and fit my needs better.

1. Easy to install, has worked well so far. It fit my pick-up very well and I would recommend this product. In my opinion a good value as well.
2. definitely worth the price.  just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release.
3. Product is just as described, works just like a ratchet strap.  Excellent deal!!  Would buy more if needed more.  Thanks
4. Arrived as promissed and in good condition, performs as advertised and fits my need as was hoped for. A good buy for the moned, strong, adjusts easy aand seem of good quality.
5. The ratchet part works great. The only con I have is the rubber pads on the ends are too hard and you just can't that last click to get it tight enough to stay in place.

2. ...for sure!  I used to have one of these bars that had to be twisted to make do.  It was okay, but cumbersome.  This is much better.  With just a bit of experimenting, I got the hang of it - installing and uninstalling - quickly.  So far, no "pinches", either; perhaps I was forewarned by the misadventures of others, but I'm nevertheless cautious!  It grips tightly, and doesn't slip; it packs up to a small, manageable size; what's not to like?  BTW, I'm using this to hold up the folded rear seat of our '13 2-Dr Jeep Wrangler.  For whatever reason, MOPAR did not provide a latch of any sort to hold the back seat up, out of the way, when folded.  The result was an incessant flopping back and forth - totally unacceptable.  This solved the problem immediately, and at reasonable cost.  I saw a strap advertised for the same purpose, but couldn't figure how - or to what - it might attach.  This, to quote a phrase, is "more better"!
3. Just received it for Christmas.  Seems like it will do the job, but when I extended it in my F150, it felt real flimsy at the ratchet point.  I'll have to give it a good try to see if it's sturdy enough to hold a load without sliding around, but I'm not sure.  Compared to one my dad has in his Tundra, this one feels weak.
4. Performs exactly as expected. My only suggestion is to modify it to keep it from rattling. The bar rattles some while traveling at higher speeds. The rattling comes from the center of the bar where the ratchet is as the bar has some &#34;give and take&#34; where one slides into the other. I would imagine engineers could insert some plastic or matting inside the sleeve as cushioning to prevent the rattling, but maybe this is asking too much for a cargo bar. I may devise a way myself to rid the rattling. This is only a minor issue and it still is a great product.
5. Great for my F-150 4x4, holds well off-road in tough terrain.  Just a wee bit tricky to learn to operate at first, blame instructions on one word, instead of saying "rotate" should say "pull over" for the lever, engage last black notch (so easy to miss), then adjust length to short or long quickly.

3. This bar fits my Dodge Ram 1500 fine and seems to have plenty of strength. It even held our new washer in place when I brought it home. My only possible complaint is the ratcheting mechanism is, well, pinchy. I have already pinched my fingers in it several times and have only owned it for about 3 weeks. My advice is to just be careful or wear gloves while adjusting it.
4. The ratchet on the tightening mechanism is too coarse (needs to be finer) and consequently, in order to tighten it beyond initial contact you stand the chance of bending the sheet metal in the side walls.Other than that, it works perfectly.............
5. definitely worth the price.  just need to learn to use it efficiently in the beginning and it works great !  recommend it for the price, does the job but takes just a bit to learn the ropes with the little ratchet release.

I thought this cargo bar would be easier to place in a lot let time.I hold my tool chess in place in the front of our truck bed. When I went to place this cargo bar, I could not get it tight using the ratchet at the end of the handle sweep. I found I had to rotate the handle about straight out, then give it one or two more clicks. It did slip once while I was adjusting last click.

Similar to review 100 - It fits fine on my 2012 Toyota Tacoma Access Cab.  I bought this and the stabilizer bar to keep my cooler(s) from trashing my truck bed.So EZ even a cavemen can use it!Ok, he might have a few cuts while trying!! :
1. I've used this several times over three months on a 2013 Chevy Avalanche and it works extremely well.

4. This bar is easy to adjust and the ratcheting feature lets you tighten it down perfectly.  It works great on my Ford Ranger pickup.  I wish I had bought one of these for my truck years ago!  No more cargo rolling around in the truck's bed!
5. I have a 2007 Tacoma that I broke the tailgate on, so as a temporary repair I got a tailgate net and one of these bars to help prevent bed flex and also for when there was stuff in the bed. Ratchet mechanism took all of 30 seconds to figure out. Works fine install took maybe 1 minute, and it stays in place. Tightened down a bit and it was secure. The only reason for 4 stars was it does seem a little bit cheap in the material it's made out of but for the price it's great and hopefully it doesn't rust.

5. I like these bars they are easy to use and stay in place, with the rubber encased feet the hold wherever you install them, they will extend to full width of bed or retract to between wheel wells. only had the for short time but I do like them.I would recommend them to a friend.the shipping time was less than expected. overall very happy with product and service.
