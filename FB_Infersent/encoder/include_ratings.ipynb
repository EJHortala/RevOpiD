      "9. long lasting pens,no smudging always perfect the first time and very well constructed\n",
      "10. This Bic pen writes very well and is long lasting\n",

      "1. If you're into blue ball point pens, this is where its at\n",
      "2. This red pen is SWEET! would highly recommond to someone looking for this, only downside is it could be  bigger~\n",
      "3. If your looking for cheap then this is what you need to get, If your looking for fancy and attractive this is not it for you\n",
      "4. Overall a good buy, although for some reason the black was not available which is what most people like, but the blue is fine, too\n",
      "5. They're basic and blue which is what you expect when you're buying these\n",
      "6. If you want a basic blue ballpoint, this is it\n",

      "1. Bic Pens: from plain (like these) to \"fancy\", they write, they write, they write -- they are inexpensive, seem to last a looong time, and create GREAT multiple copies because you press em as hard as you want and they write, they write, they write\n",
      "2. I think we've all used these pens for thousands of years, or so it seems!  This is usually one product on which you can count, to not leak all over the place and still write nicely, and for a long time\n",
      "3. I always carry at least two or three packs of these pens with me as invariably, sure as the sun rises, there will be at least one or two kids who forgot their pen or pencil (I always keep several packages of pencils too\n",
      "4. Isn't that what really counts at the end of the day?One minor complaint I have about these pens is that the caps tend to crack if you put them on tightly\n",
      "5. I like the new design and how comfortable they are to write with, but only annoyance is that the caps are SO hard to pull off initially!!  I had to keep twisting and tugging on the caps of all of the pens I've used to far\n",
      "6. These pens will serve your check book well (does anyone still use those things? I do, but I'm old school like that), take great notes in school, and scribble a quick note at your desk without fuss\n",
      "7. I would say that there are maybe 1-2 duds per pack of 60, but it was the cheapest pen I could find online, and much more reliable than freebie promotional pens\n",
      "8. So, the Bic Round Stick Pen Medium Point is a nice little pen!They&#8217;re not fancy, but I was tired of paying $4 for a 2-pen set from Walgreens/CVS/The Local Grocer and such and decided to go ahead and try these as they came 60 in a box&#8230; And so basically for pennies on the dollar I have enough pens that should last myself and my relatives (as they always seem to borrow my work supplies&#8230;) well throughout the year!They work fine, come with caps and so far have not bled out in my bag like some other cheaper pens of the past\n",
      "9. So, if you just want something to write with that doesn&#8217;t have to come with the bells and whistles of a personalized gold pen, or say a calligraphy pen set, then I think anyone would be satisfied with this offering from the folks at Bic\n",
      "10. five stars for the price, i got them very cheap;  with four  kids that use pens often  and loose them even more often the price was awesome; will be buying more later\n",
      "11. I LOVE LOVE LOVE these! This is my Second Order of these which I have placed! When I find something that works as nice and well as These Do, I am a Very Happy Camper! These are really Good Quality Pens and they last! I have really gotten tired of purchasing pens that run out of ink, with very little use\n",
      "12. I would recommend these pens to anyone who journals, does a lot of writing, or simply needs a pen that is Reliable and great to use! I would have rated these a TEN if there were more stars! Thanks BIC and AMAZON! These were a Great Deal and well worth purchasing!\n",
      "13. I love the fact that 10 pens allows several throughout the house so they're always available when you need it - especially by the phones with a pad\n",
      "14. If you want to have enough of a nice normal no fuss pen that writes smoothly to get through the zombie apocalypse, if you need to get a crowd jotting things down or if you have to keep a stash of pens because you are surrounded by office supplies thieves then this is the affordable pack of lovely blue pens for you\n",

      "1. Thus, the cheaply made pen is purchased at an inflated rate, performs cheaply, and then makes it's most prominent impact on the world--not as a writing device, but as another poisonous piece of plastic, sent to join a landfill or float in an ocean: either way, rotting the earth\n",
      "2. The Bic Round Stic pen is the cancer that keeps on giving; I wouldn't wish this junk product on my worst enemy, and I encourage anyone interested in giving this shameful company any money for this, or another, disposable piece of garbage to strongly reconsider and fork up the extra dough to purchase something that is made with actual quality\n",

      "3. 36 pens with 2-day Amazon Prime delivery? Yes please! Seriously though, these are just what you expect: good old Bic ball point pens\n",
      "4. 17 almost the cost of the items which are Bic pens\n",
      "5. This box of 60 I bought, arrived and I counted an exact 44 pens in it, not sure where the remaining 16 went to\n",
      "6. I have used at least 20 of them so far & have yet to come across one that doesn't work well\n",
      "7. This package, as an 'add-on' item, cost under 10 cents per pen so I ordered two and took them in\n",
      "8. I tend to lose a lot of pens before they run out of ink, so can't speak to how long they'll last, but I'm sure i'll be buying these again once i lose all 60 again\n",
      "9. 60 pens in one box for a low price! I haven't used all the pens so far, but what I've used and given away worked without problems\n",
      "10. So why buy a box of 60 pens, when it takes forever just to use up a single pen?There are lots of reasons, the biggest being the well known fact that once you set a pen down and look away they grow legs and walk off\n",
      "11. At the time of this review this box of 60 pens is only 54 cents higher in cost than buying a 10 pack on Amazon\n",
      "12. So for 54 cents you get 50 more pens, that's an obviously fantastic deal\n",
      "13. Except that they work, even after sitting long periods of time!  I haven't had a single issue with any of these pens\n",
      "14. 6 (7 if you round) cents a pen\n",
      "15. The item was entirely wrapped in tape, precluding the possibility of being unintentionally opened, and promptly arrived in less than three days of ordering\n",

      "3. Used to purchase pens from costco and sams club but they wouldn't write on paper when written on top of glass\n",
      "4. I carry a very large canvas pouch with me stuffed with stuff\n",
      "5. I have the little twerps! And I don't even have to be mean about it like I do with the endless bathroom and drink requests\n",
      "6. As an additional advantage, I do not mind writing short notes with them myself, and I am one of those people who are constantly misplacing pens all over the house and at my desk\n",
      "7. For you pen chewers out there you can chew away, and always have another in the box you can lend out without getting those looks (you know what I'm talking about)\n",
      "8. I buy a big box of pens and keep some at home, in kitchen, by computer, books, in my bag, a few to give and forget aboutwhen someone asks to \"borrow a pen\",\n",
      "9. What a good deal, with prime! Enough pens to keep my volleyball team writing away on their statistics sheets for a couple season, hopefully\n",
      "10. They taste great with a little garlic butter and tomato sauce over pasta\n",
      "11. Great price, came quickly - so many pens leftover from my project (handing them out at a booth) that I'll be set for pens for a while :)\n",
      "12. You can even fling the pen caps! I love these pens but whatever you do, don't put them in the freezer\n",
